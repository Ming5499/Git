The first step is to create and populate a local PostgreSQL instance. You’ll need to clone the below GitHub repo. The repo contains all the code and files you’ll use throughout the tutorial

git clone https://github.com/vicradon/postgres-airbyte-snowflake-tut.git

After cloning the repo, navigate to the clone repo. Then create a new database.

createdb airbyte_tut -U postgres

After creating the database, run the command below to create a table, movies and populate it with data.

psql -d airbyte_tut -f movies.sql -U postgres

Now, enter the psql shell as user postgres, psql -U postgres, then connect to the airbyte_tut database, \c airbyte_tut. Next, create a dedicated read-only user that will have access to the relevant tables in the airbyte_tut database.

CREATE USER airbyte PASSWORD 'your_password_here';

Then, give the Airbyte user access to the airbtye_tut database.

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO airbyte;
