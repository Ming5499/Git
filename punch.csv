Babalola said this while declaring open the eighth edition of the Afe Babalola Agricultural Expo, ABAEX, an annual gathering of farmers, where they would be empowered by the ABUAD founder.

Babalola that the local councils have remained ineffective over the years in bringing development to the people, due to the activities of the governors who allegedly hijacked their allocations.
He explained that releasing funds to the council areas would enable the administrators to contribute to the socioeconomic development of the communities, especially supporting farmers. 
He said, “I am suggesting that local government areas should be empowered. Each local government should set up farming equipment for farmers to hire. They should also earmark large hectares of land for the farmers to farm.

“When I was a councillor, in those days, local government funds used to come directly to them. We all know what has been happening to their money.
“I think the current president (Bola Tinubu) should do all he can to ensure that local government allocation gets to them directly and not through the governors because they (governors) steal a lot. No parent will send their children to school, some to masters and PhD level, only to come back and be asked to use cutlass to farm.      
“The best the government can do now to revive agriculture is to buy modern implements to encourage people to farm. If local government funds get to them they will be able to buy tractors for the people to rent.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/14135745/Afe-Babalola.fw_.png

Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city that lies in a region bordering Russia, has been under routine shelling since Moscow’s forces invaded in February last year.
“Another targeted attack by Russia on civilians. The body of a 10-year-old child was found under the ruins,” Igor Klymenko said on Friday in a statement.
The regional governor, Oleg Synyegubov, said 23 people, including an 11-month-old child, had been injured, adding that search operations are ongoing. 
The police service and Synyegubov said the city had been hit twice by Russian cruise missiles.  Related News   
“One of the missiles hit a road; windows were broken in neighbouring houses. The second missile hit a three-storey residential building, causing a fire,” Synyegubov said.
Rescue workers were extinguishing a fire next to a charred vehicle and missile fragments lay at the bottom of a deep crater in the centre of the city, an AFP journalist at the scene said.      
The attack comes less than 24 hours after one of the deadliest strikes in months left more than 50 people dead in a village in the same region.
Swathes of the Kharkiv region were captured by Russian forces in the early days of their invasion but Ukrainian forces have clawed back much of it since a lightning offensive late last year.

The Court of Appeal in Abuja had in a judgment delivered on October 13, 2022, ordered Kanu’s release.
In a unanimous decision by a three-member panel, the appellate court also quashed the terrorism charges filed against the IPOB leader by the Federal Government.
However, dissatisfied with the judgment, the Federal Government appealed at the Supreme Court. 
At the proceedings on Thursday, a five-member panel of the apex court headed by Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, fixed the matter for judgment after the parties adopted their final briefs.

“We urge My Lords to uphold our cross-appeal and do substantial justice to this matter in favour of the respondent who has been in detention since June 29, 2021, even after the lower court ordered his release. My Lords should also order that he should never be prosecuted again on the same counts.      
“They are still holding him unconstitutionally. We pray My Lords to deliver justice and use this case, just like in Ojukwu vs. State, to demonstrate that no man or government should be above the law,” Ozekhome said.
However, FG’s lawyer, Tijani Ghazali (SAN), urged the apex court to set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal which ordered Kanu’s release.

The House charged its downstream Petroleum Resources Committee to look into any environmental harm brought on by oil firms’ disregard for the law.
Following a proposal made on Wednesday at the plenary session by Ahmadu Jaha of the APC in Borno, the resolution was passed.
Jaha, who presented the motion, claimed that many oil wells in oil-producing areas have been drained and are no longer economically viable, leading local and multinational oil and gas firms to sell up their previous upstream holdings. 
According to the report, to prevent environmental problems or disruption with other marine operations, it is best practice internationally to decommission oil well sites that are financially unviable.
According to Jaha, citing section 232 of the PIA, the legislation mandates that oil corporations must guarantee that the environment returns to its natural state after the conclusion of their exploratory activities by dismantling and removing non-viable sites.

The community folks, including men, women and youths in their teeming numbers, blocked the entrance of the community on Thursday, demanding the provision of social amenities from the international oil companies operating in their area.
They alleged that for about 60 years, the presence of four multinational oil firms, such as Shell, NDPR, TotalEnergies and Agip in their community, had not translated to social amenities and a good life for them.
But the protest was reportedly halted by heavily-armed soldiers who drove into the area in about six Hilux vans.

According to him, about 25 canopies and 2,000 chairs were seized from the protesters.
“Nobody was shot, but they arrested two of the protesters. They arrested Mr. Godknows and Edward Uka. These are the people they forwarded their names and I do not know the reason for the arrest,” the councillor stated.

The motion was sponsored by Senator Zam Tartenger (APC- Benue). 
Tartenger, in his lead debate, noted that farmers in the Gwer-West, Malardi and Guma local government areas of Benue State had been sacked and displaced by bandits masquerading as herders in the last seven years.
He said, “This has resulted in the people taking abode at camps under deplorable and excruciating conditions at Naka, Agagbe, Ahagena North Bank, Daud, Umanger, and Ghajingba in Gwer-West, Makurdi and Guma local government areas.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission filed 10 counts against Ibeto alongside his company, Ibeto Energy Development, before Justice Ismail Ijelu.
The charges border on obtaining by pretences, fraudulent conversion of property, criminal breach of trust, forgery, and deception.
EFCC said the offences contravened Section 1 of the Advance Fee Fraud Act 2006 and Section 365(3d) and (e), 366 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. 
When the matter was called on Thursday, the prosecuting counsel for the EFCC, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), noted that the matter was for the arraignment of the defendants.

Rather, he said the former Lagos State governor abandoned him as well as the Action Congress of Nigeria and supported Umaru Yar’Adua of the PDP in the 2007 presidential poll.
Atiku also recalled how he saved Tinubu by not allowing former President Olusegun Obasanjo to take over Lagos State in the 2007 general elections.
However, the All Progressives Congress has knocked Atiku following his Thursday attack on Tinubu, saying his ill-timed press conference was in gross contempt of the Supreme Court. 
The National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Felix Morka, said the ruling party was not bothered by Atiku’s claims, which it said lacked purpose and delivered nothing except “the pitiful regurgitation of lies, mindless distortions and deliberate falsehood on Atiku’s infantile obsession with the academic record of the president.’’
But Atiku, who was the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the February elections, vowed not to give up on his quest to prove that Tinubu forged the Chicago State University certificate he submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission before the polls.
Addressing a press conference in Abuja on Thursday, the former VP also urged the presidential candidates of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, and New Nigeria Peoples Party, Rabiu Kwankwaso, to support his quest for justice.      
He expressed concern that Nigeria’s reputation was at stake, adding that “We must uphold Nigeria’s election ground rule (constitution).”
The Thursday press conference marked the third time Atiku addressed journalists since INEC declared Tinubu of the APC the winner of the presidential election.
Those who attended the world press conference were former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki; ex-Cross River State Governor, Liyel Imoke; former National Chairmen of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus; and Senator Iyorchia Ayu, among others.
In addition to filing an election petition appeal at the Supreme Court to challenge the judgment of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal which upheld Tinubu’s victory, the PDP standard bearer had sought the academic records of the President from the Chicago State University to prove his allegation of forgery against the former Lagos State governor.
Magistrate Jeffrey Gilbert had on September 19 granted Atiku’s request for the release of Tinubu’s academic records but the President challenged the ruling, but his objection that the documents would not be relevant in Atiku’s appeal at the Supreme Court was overruled by federal judge Nancy Maldonado, who directed the CSU to release the president’s academic records.
Responding to questions from newsmen during the news conference, Atiku denied reports that his action was a betrayal of the ex-Lagos State governor, noting that Tinubu is indebted to him for preventing former President Olusegun Obasanjo from dethroning him as governor in 2007.
He revealed, “In 2007, we came together to form ACN (Action Congress of Nigeria) and in Lagos at the convention, I emerged and got the ticket. And after the convention, a few of our friends who are here met me and told me Bola wanted to be my running mate. So, I asked for their opinion on Muslim-Muslim ticket.        
“All of them said they objected. So, I asked them why didn’t they tell him? So, that was the end of our political relationship; it broke away as he went ahead and supported Yar’adua. So where is the ground for him to say I betrayed him?’’
Speaking further, he added, “Those of you who are old enough will remember that in 2003 the PDP took over all the states in the South-West, with the exception of Lagos. I stood before Obasanjo and said no, you can’t take Lagos. And he left it. So, who is indebted to the other: Is it me or Tinubu? Tinubu is indebted to me.’’
The PDP presidential candidate, who lamented how former President Muhammadu Buhari allegedly dealt with some of his business entities, said he was not scared Tinubu would go after his business interest, adding “It has already been taken away from me since the Buhari administration. They took it and distributed it among themselves.”
Atiku fights on
Atiku who pledged to fight on, promised to sheath his sword after the Supreme Court must have passed judgment on the matter.
Justifying his demand for Tinubu’s CSU records, Atiku explained, “We undertook this journey at great cost and for important reasons. The ground rules for legitimate governance in our country need to be upheld, and the reputation of our country is at stake. That affects everyone, Nigerians everywhere.’’
He added, “I am a democrat by conviction and a citizen of a country that I love. The issues at stake in this case require us once more to re-dedicate ourselves to both the country and our constitution.
“I wish to pay tribute to the late human rights activist, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, SAN, who inspired us on this path of discovery. Now, he can truly rest in peace in the assurance that what he started about 23 years ago has come to fruition.      
“Gani’s vindication today gives credence to the saying that no matter how fast a lie runs, the truth will someday overtake it. This quest is not for or about Atiku Abubakar. It is a quest for the enthronement of truth, morality, and accountability in our public affairs.’’
Calling for mass support for his crusade, the PDP candidate said, ‘’In line with this, therefore, I am calling on all well-meaning Nigerians, leaders of thought, our religious leaders, our traditional leaders, our community leaders, our political leaders, and in particular, (ex) Governor Peter Obi of the Labour Party and (ex) Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso of the NNPP and the leaders of every political party in Nigeria and, indeed, every single person who loves this country, as I do, and who wishes nothing but the best for the country, as I do, to join me in this campaign to enshrine probity, accountability and the basic principles of justice, morality and uprightness in our country and our government.”
Atiku’s lawyer, Kalu Kalu alleged that the CSU confirmed that Tinubu forged the certificate he presented to INEC.
“Also, the qualifying certificates from Southwest College to Chicago bear a female indicating that the document does not belong to Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
“The CSU admission has a claim that Bola Ahmed Tinubu attended government college, Lagos, and graduated in 1970 when indeed, the school was established in 1974. We were told by the CSU Registrar that the A in CSU stands for Adekunle, but the A in the certificate submitted by Bola Tinubu to INEC has the NYSC certificate as Adekunle,’’ he further claimed.
Kalu declared that the Supreme Court had held that they could permit a party to adduce fresh evidence as long as certain conditions were met, adding that “from what transpired in the proceedings in US courts, that condition is going to be met. So as we speak, our law is very clear that a party at fault cannot be allowed to enjoy the fruit of his illegality.”
Meanwhile, Atiku has reportedly filed fresh evidence obtained from the Chicago State University, United States to strengthen his appeal in the Supreme Court against Tinubu.    Related News   Chicago varsity record: After US expedition, Presidential poll battle returns to Supreme Court  Atiku: Tinubu’s friend indeed  Herders: Presidential committee versus naysayers   
A credible source, who is close to the former Vice President, exclusively disclosed that Atiku submitted fresh evidence.
Responding to a question from our correspondent on the matter, the source said “ Yes, we have submitted fresh evidence to the Supreme Court before the deadline.”
APC kicks
But Morka dismissed Atiku’s charges against the President as a display of desperation and an attempt to whip up public sentiments and put the Supreme Court under pressure.
He said, “For several weeks now, Nigerians and the world have watched with incredulity Alhaji Abubakar’s display of utter desperation in his failed bid to become the President of Nigeria.
‘’Earlier today (Thursday), he put his desperation in overdrive during his press conference where he addressed some of the issues in his appeal at the Supreme Court and bandying unproven charges against the President of Nigeria, His Excellency Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in a calculated attempt to shamelessly whip up public sentiments and inordinately pressure the Supreme Court.
“We believe Atiku should have known better than to demonstrate gross contempt of the highest court by making public comments on a matter that he has submitted to the court for adjudication.
‘’The major take-away from his Yar’Adua Centre show, especially at question time, was that Atiku harbours deep animosity towards Tinubu whom he believes was responsible for his electoral woes in 2007, 2015, 2019 and this year.’’      
Describing Atiku’s action as unbecoming of a statesman of his stature, the APC spokesman accused the PDP standard bearer of using his fight for Tinubu’s academic records as an instrument of mischief and blackmail.
He stated, “In desperation, unbecoming of a statesman who once occupied the second highest office in the land, the PDP candidate in the last election has thrown every decency, decorum, dignity and national respectability out of the window on his purposeless judicial voyage of discovery to the United States in search of a magic wand for taking power against the will of the Nigerian electorate loudly expressed in last February’s presidential election.
“It should now be clear to all Nigerians that despite Atiku’s lies before the Illinois Court that he wanted to use the discoveries in pursuit of his appeal at the Supreme Court, he has rather chosen to use the same as an instrument of mischief and blackmail in clear contempt of the highest court of the land.
‘’We want to urge him to graciously accept his defeat and quietly lick his political wound with some dignity. Nigerians rejected him at the polls, and he cannot get by subterfuge what he failed to get through the ballot box.”
A former Director of Publicity and Media for the dissolved Tinubu-Shettima Presidential Campaign Council, Bayo Onanuga, also slammed the PDP candidate over his ‘’obsession with Tinubu’s emergence as president of the country.’’
Tinubu associates
While admonishing the former VP to deal with his desperation to become president, the veteran journalist also described his media conference as an affront and a plot to whip up sentiments against the Supreme Court.
He said, “The guy (Atiku) is just desperate. You went on a fishing expedition. What did you bring back? They are obsessed with their own version of reality, which is contrary to the fact presented to them.        
“Chicago State University already told these people that this man indeed attended our school and that he is a male, not a female. He even took an entrance exam into the school from a college. It is the same man, yet these people (PDP) are still doubting his certificate.
“The fact is obvious. Did this man attend CSU? Yes, he did. They’re just bringing up irrelevant issues. Imagine Atiku talking about the president dragging down the reputation of Nigeria. Who is more guilty of dragging the country into the mud if not this same Atiku Abubakar?
‘’Look, in the United States, Atiku’s corruption status has become legendary. The last time the US Congress published what they call ‘Case Report of Corruption’, Atiku featured among four or five African leaders there who were said to have siphoned money from Nigeria to America, which of course were seized from him.
‘’He was stealing from here to abroad. Tell me, who has dragged Nigeria more into the mud than this guy, who is merely obsessed because he desperately wants to be president and was beaten by a first timer? Yet, he cannot just stomach the defeat.’’
Speaking further, Onanuga queried the rationale behind Atiku’s press conference which he described as a contempt of court, stressing that he should have waited for the apex court to determine his election petition appeal.
He added, ‘’Again, you said you have filed a case at the Supreme Court, what is the purpose of this press conference? Are you planning to pile pressure on the court, pre-empt the judgment or whip up sentiments against the apex court?
‘’That press conference was totally unnecessary because you have already filed a case in court. So why not wait for the Supreme Court to deliver its own judgment? Why must you come public again with what you have already filed?      
‘’This is a contempt of the highest court in the land. He and his lawyers should know better. The Supreme Court should hold them in contempt for speaking to what they are presenting before it. It is so unnecessary.”
LP reacts
Meanwhile, the leadership of the Labour Party has admonished Atiku to leave out its presidential candidate, Obi, out of his feud with the President.
The party’s response was a reaction to an earlier call by the PDP candidate on Obi and Kwankwaso, to join his crusade in exposing the alleged dirty secrets of the president.
In a statement by the National Publicity Secretary of LP, Obiora Ifoh, on Thursday, the party disclosed that its candidate shouldn’t be distracted as he is presently focused on reclaiming his ‘stolen mandate’ from the apex court.
The statement read, “The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi is presently in the Supreme Court seeking to reclaim his stolen mandate and he is focused on that.
“He has been in the vanguard of ensuring a just nation where justice must be the watchword, and he will not stop until Nigeria achieves the leadership it truly deserves. Obi has pontificated severally on the need for leaders to be good role models and to live a life worthy of emulation.
“This he has done by publicly putting his credentials in the open for verification. Nigeria will get better when men of integrity and honour drive the affairs of the nation. We therefore welcome every other interest willing to join us in our pursuit of a nation where justice shall reign.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01164730/Bola-Tinubu-Atiku-Abubakar.jpeg

He highlighted the importance of integrity and tenacity in business and urged other gladiators in the building industry to prioritise the welfare of Nigerians by reducing the costs of essential building materials. 
“We in REDAN commend Abdul Samad Rabiu for his integrity, his tenacity and for being a fairly business person, and for that reason, we call on other gladiators in the built industry that produce building materials to follow suit, somebody like Dangote and the rest of the people producing cement and other building materials in the country,” he said.

He stressed the need for affordable housing and called on industry stakeholders to contribute to achieving this goal by lowering the costs of building materials.
Acknowledging the challenges contributing to the housing deficit in Nigeria, including banditry, floods, and natural disasters, Wamakko applauded BUA Cement for its commitment to providing a solution.      
He also welcomed BUA’s engagement with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and expressed confidence that the decision to reduce cement prices would not only address housing challenges but also generate employment opportunities for Nigerians.
“When you look at the deficit in housing, is because of so many parameters, from, banditry, floods, natural disasters that come, it has added to the deficit of housing in the country and the only way forward is to get cheaper cement because cement is the primary product for building.
“So, we respect this decision from BUA cement and we welcome this decision Because it is going to provide employment to so many Nigerians,”henoted.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/06040140/Wamakko-BUA.jpg

The governor’s wife, who spoke on Thursday at the Lagos House, Alausa, during the pre-conference press briefing for the National Women Conference organised by the Committee of Wives of Lagos State Officials, said orphans in the state are now being covered under the Lagos State Health Insurance Scheme.
“The orphans in the orphanages, it was difficult for them to access health care in the past, because in the hospitals they would require their father and mother, but they don’t have those parents to stay with them. So, we made a case for them, and now LASHMA has gone around to ensure that all the orphans in Lagos State under the registered orphanages are captured in the nearest hospital to the orphanage,” she said.

“So, any child that doesn’t get attention, it is because, maybe, that orphanage has not registered that child. And that helps us to monitor what is happening in those orphanages.”
Speaking on the women’s conference, with the theme ‘Unleash Your Potential’, the governor’s wife and Chairman of COWLSO said the 2023 edition, which will be held at the Convention Centre, Eko Hotels & Suites from October 17 to 19, is aimed at challenging participants “to take bold steps, face their fears, and push past their comfort zones, and when they do, they can ‘unleash their potential’ and discover what they are truly capable of achieving.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20235931/Ibijoke-Sanwo-Olu.jpg

Those killed were said to have been hit by stray bullets fired by the security operatives deployed to the affected communities, following the resumption of hostilities.
When our correspondent visited the area Thursday afternoon, both Ilobu and Ifon could not be accessed by even some of the security operatives, as they stayed at the entrance to the two communities.
The Otun-Jagun of Ilobu, Chief Leke Ogunsola, who spoke to newsmen on behalf of Ilobu community said four lives, including a baby, had been lost to the crisis on the side of the town. 
He also lamented the refusal of the security agents deployed to go into the areas in the two communities.
“The government intervention is not enough because of security agencies that were drafted to the area stationed themselves at Ojutu bridge. They didn’t enter the town where the clashes happened. So far, from Ilobu community, we have recorded four fatalities including a baby,” Ogunsola said.
The casualty figure on the side of Ifon people could not be immediately obtained but pictures of four different corpses allegedly hit by stray bullets of security agents were sent to our correspondent by the residents of the town.      
The Secretary, Ifon-Orolu Progressive Union, Board of Trustees, Prince Jide Akinyooye, who addressed journalists on behalf of the Ifon community, said several houses were razed during the attack on the town.
He said, “The gazette that ceded parts of the land belonging to Ifon to Ilobu during Rauf Aregbesola’s regime has been causing the crisis. We are in danger. We have tried to avoid reprisal but the refusal of the police to act may lead to another thing. Several houses were burnt.”
Meanwhile, Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke, has directed that none of the two communities should be seen near the disputed land.

Speaking at the ‘Ipade Imole’ – a public enlightenment programme organised by his administration held in Osogbo on Thursday, Adeleke said, “I have given a directive that nobody should be seen on the disputed land. Anybody they see there should be arrested and prosecuted. The state government has taken over the disputed land.
“The kings and leaders should come together. By the time the government takes over all your land, reality will dawn on you. I have informed the Chief of Army Staff, Taoreed Lagbaja, who hails from Ilobu. We have given a standing order to the soldiers to be in charge.”
As a result of the crises, many residents of Ilobu and Ifon communities have fled their houses.
During our correspondent’s visit to Ojutu Area of Ilobu on Thursday, residents of Ilobu and Ifon were observed moving out of the affected areas in large numbers.        
Our correspondent also observed that corps members serving in the affected areas were being evacuated by the state government.
Soldiers, operatives of the Department of State Security, and police operatives were seen at the entrance to the two communities.
Osun Police Command spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, while commenting on the situation in the two towns, said, “They burnt a new patrol van of police yesterday (Wednesday).
“They alleged us of taking a side. It is unfortunate that the Monitoring Section van that was donated to us was burnt. Our four men are in hospital now, they were shot. The Divisional Police Officer of Ilobu was among those who were shot. He was shot in the hand. But thanks to God, they are all responding to treatment. They ambushed policemen when our men attempted to broker peace in the area.”

According to Abdulraheem, Jejeloye disclosed that residents and commuters who ply the route complained of the activities of the bus operators at Jibowu “who converted those areas to roadside courier stations and mini garages.”
“It is sad to see these transport operators move their business from their premises down to the main road meant for free vehicular movement just for their selfish gains. 
“Their actions cause increased travel time and unnecessary chaos once it gets dark,” the statement quoted Jejeloye as saying.

This is, however, contrary to a report (not by The PUNCH) claiming he was abducted by gunmen.
The report quoted his wife as saying her husband was kidnapped in the early hours of Wednesday. 
However, a statement by the DSS titled, “ICPC seeks DSS collaboration on the UNICAL sex scandal matter” noted that the ICPC arrested him on October 4, following a court order.
The Director, Public Relations and Strategic Communications, the DSS National Headquarters, Peter Afunanya, said Ndifon was arrested with the support of the DSS.

The statement read, “The ICPC has sought the collaboration of the Department of State Services on the University of Calabar sex scandal matter involving Prof Cyril Ndifon, the erstwhile Dean of the Faculty of Law of the institution.      
“The commission had disclosed the refusal of Ndifon to honour its several invitations, thus his eventual arrest in Calabar, Cross River State by its operatives on October 4, 2023, was based on a court order.
“However, the Service, following the commission’s request and in the spirit of interagency cooperation, supported it for a successful operation.
“This is to guide public understanding of the latest developments on the matter.”

They said if left unattended to, the situation may lead to an outbreak of diseases in the market.
When our correspondent visited the market on Thursday, it was observed that the heap of refuse was located at the centre of the market with stench oozing from it.
The market leader of Ado-Odo, Babatunde Bakare, noted that the stench coming from the refuse heap has deterred customers from patronising the market while residents in the area have also complained of health issues occasioned by the refuse. 
Bakare said, “We have made efforts to call on the government, most especially those in the area office close to us, to see ways they can help us to evacuate the refuse because it has deterred people from patronising the market because it is closer to the foodstuffs stand.
“Also, the refuse heap is about 20 metres away from houses across the market. If you get to our health centre, there are several reports of health issues, which have been linked to the refuse dump. Although the market activities come up every five days, the dangers of the odour coming from the market has put residents at health risks.”  Related News   Ogun approves 1,000 teachers’ recruitment  How my Chinese boyfriend abandoned me with his child - Ogun woman  Abiodun’s aide dismisses ex-LG boss’ allegation on fund diversion   
Bakare appealed to the state governor, Dapo Abiodun, and the local government authorities to come to their rescue by evacuating the refuse to save the community from airborne diseases and food poisoning.      
A community leader who identified herself simply as Mrs Amoleogun said that whenever it rains, the odour becomes unbearable for residents of the area.
“We are appealing to the government to come and help us to clear this refuse. We are at risk of diseases because of the odour that comes from the refuse heap especially when it rains. We have reached out to local authorities but nothing has been done,” She said.
The community youth leader, Adelaja Adeyinka, urged the government to come to the community’s rescue to avert the outbreak of diseases.
“The government should come and help us to evacuate this refuse so that cases of disease spread can be averted,” Adeyinka said.

The state Commissioner of Information, Binta Mammam, disclosed this on Thursday during a post-executive council meeting press briefing.

This is following the attack on the FRSC office by a mob on Tuesday morning.
It was learnt that the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority, the FRSC, and Vehicle Inspection Officers among other agencies make use of the LCDA building, making them vulnerable to attacks by the mob.
PUNCH Metro reported on Tuesday that angry youths from Ago Palace in Okota razed facilities at the LCDA office leaving several vehicles belonging to the council damaged. The FRSC office rooms and other property were also damaged. 
The youths were protesting the death of two persons during a scuffle involving LASTMA officials, a policeman and a driver in the area.
The Lagos Sector Commander, FRSC, Babatunde Farinloye, in an interview with PUNCH Metro after the incident, said such incidents had been happening before now.
“I have written a letter to the Department of State Services and they have not done anything about it. I have told the Commissioner of Police that the activities of the LASTMA people and task force are attracting attacks. Maybe with time, we may have to look for another office, either they move out or we move out,” Farinloye said.

He said whenever such operations happened, people often mistook LASTMA officials for FRSC men.
“(Some) people don’t know the difference between the Road Safety and LASTMA. For any small thing, they would say it is Road Safety officials and they start attacking the officers or our facilities,” Babatunde added.
LASTMA spokesperson, Adebayo Taofiq, has not responded to a message from our correspondent seeking the agency’s reaction as of press time.
But when contacted, the Isolo LCDA lamented property loss to the Tuesday mob action, adding that steps had been taken to avert such occurrences in the future.
“The Tuesday incident was unpalatable to us as a government. The Chairman, Bayo Olasoju, upon visiting the scene, has taken steps towards averting such happenings in the future. He’s tackling it headlong.
“We are collaborating with relevant agencies for a thorough investigation and necessary action will follow,” Rasheed Iskilu, the Chief Press Secretary to the council chairman said in a statement sent to our correspondent.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/14001658/FRSC.jpg

The deceased, a 45-year-old farmer and trader who hailed from Ikot Otu was beaten to death when he visited his sister-in-law in Adiasim Ikot Ekon to condole her on her husband’s death.
The sister-in-law had told the court that she asked the deceased to accompany her to her late husband’s farmland to assess how much she could sell it for his burial when the wife of the second convict saw them and alerted her husband that someone was trying to bury a charm on their family land.
She told the court that arriving on the farmland, the second convict started beating the deceased, while his wife also invited her son and her brother-in-law who joined in the fray, attacking the deceased with a machete and broken bottles.

Chidinma Ikeanyionwu, the media aide to the state Commissioner for Women and Social Welfare, Ify Obinabo, disclosed this in a statement made available to journalists on Wednesday.
The ministry had in August 2023 sealed off the orphanage located in Nkwelle 33, near Onitsha over allegations of illegal adoption and selling of children.
About 20 children, including a newborn baby, were recovered from the orphanage while the founder and the employees reportedly fled at the time. 
The government’s decision came after an investigative piece published by the Foundation for Investigative Journalism exposed the orphanage for allegedly trading babies for cash.
The report published on August 10, 2023, was an outcome of a 19-month investigation conducted by an investigative journalist, Fisayo Soyombo.  Related News   Edo shuts down orphanage where child was sold for N1.7m   
But in the Wednesday statement, Ikeanyionwu said when the founder was asked why it took her two months to surface after the sealing off of the home, she claimed that she was sick and, hence, could not come when she was summoned.      
The statement read, “The Anambra State Commissioner for Women and Social Welfare has handed over the Founder of Arrows of God Community Children’s Home in Nkwelle 33, Rev D.C Ogo, to men of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons for illegal adoption.
“This was done following an investigative report which made the rounds on social media and local television stations alleging that the state Ministry of Women and Social Welfare was involved in an illegal adoption of a baby girl alongside one of her registered homes in the state.”
The statement quoted the commissioner as lamenting over the bad image Ogo has given the state.
The commissioner was said to have warned other children’s home operators to desist from all forms of illegalities that would bring bad name to the state.
“On why she carried out the adoption process, despite the commissioner’s warning, Ogo could not come up with any reasonable excuse to the question, but rather said it was her Secretary, one Mr Monday who handled the adoption,” the statement added.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/04225433/Rev-D.C-Ogo.jpg

The News Agency of Nigeria quoted the Director, of Development Control, FCTA, Mr Mukhtar Galadima, as saying that the exercise was also to restore the Abuja Master Plan and improve serenity and security in the capital city.
“To a large extent, what we are doing now is enhancing the security architecture of the FCT and enhancing the architectural quality of the city.
“This is why we are removing shanties, which to a large extent will improve the serenity of the capital city,” he said. 
Galadima explained that the shanties in Jahi District were erected on a proposed arterial corridor beginning from the Nnamdi Azikiwe Ring Road.
He said the department would consult with relevant stakeholders on what needed to be done in the area before the main road goes into operation.
The director added that the department had continually sensitised settlers against erecting shanties in unauthorised locations.

Galadima advised occupants of shanties across Abuja to pack their valuables and appealed to residents to report any emerging shanties in any location to relevant authorities.
The Secretary, Command and Control Unit, Department of Security Services, FCTA, Mr Peter Olumuji, said social vices were rampant in shanties.
He said that “strangler”, equipment used by “one-chance” criminals who rob and push passengers out of moving vehicles could be readily found in the shanties.
“Once they use this to strangle a person, there is no way the person will survive and if he or she survives, any item he or she is holding will drop,” he said.
He stressed that the clean-up in Jahi would curb insecurity between the Gwarinpa Housing Estate and the Mabushi area.
Olumuji added that the cashew plantation in the area was also removed because the plantation served as a haven for criminals.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/04225130/illegal-structures.jpg

Also joined in the suit are the state Commissioner for Women Affairs and the state Attorney-General.
The claimant, who lost her husband some months ago, said the victim was admitted into the juvenile home in 2017 when he was three months old while she was in a hospital receiving treatment.
She said the juvenile home offered to take custody of her three children to enable her to follow up on her treatment, but she and her mother agreed to leave only Omoniyi in the home. 
Upon her full recovery a month later, she said she went back to the juvenile home with her mother to demand her baby boy, but she was told that her child had died and the corpse had been deposited at the mortuary of the Ondo State Specialist Hospital.
According to her, on getting to the state hospital, she was told that the hospital did not receive any corpse of a child from the juvenile home at that period and all petitions on the matter to the state Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, the Ministry of Women Affairs and the Department of State Services, had yielded no result.
Adegboyega, who filed the suit through her lawyer, Mr Oju Kekemeke, sought an order of the court directing the defendants to account for the whereabouts of the boy whose disappearance occurred while in the custody of the juvenile home under the supervision of the state Ministry of Women Affairs.      
She also sought an order of the court to direct the defendants to pay her N50m as “exemplary and aggravated damages,” N40m as general damages for the excruciating pain, anguish, personal loss, and psychological trauma caused by the negligent act of the defendants, as well as N5m damages as “cost of this action.”
The claimant also sought a court order that 15per cent interest per annum be paid on the judgment sum from the date of the judgment until the judgment sum is finally liquidated.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/01230558/ROTIMI-AKEREDOLU.jpg

The female junior class student who did not notice the oncoming Nissan car got knocked down in the process. 
A resident of the area said, “We were told that the incident happened around 1pm. The car had been parked there since morning when the teacher arrived. We don’t know how it managed to move from the position.

The Osun State Government has imposed a curfew on the Irepodun and Orolu local government areas after communal clashes were witnessed on Wednesday.
While security men have been mobilised to the scene of the clashes, the Regent of Ifon, Chief Babatunde Oyetunji, in a statement by his media aide, Mufutau Muideen, accused the people of Ilobu of attacking Ifon.
The statement further read in parts, “It is unfortunate that two people have been shot by suspected gunmen who shot two people at Gbere-Odofin – Oba Road after they were identified as indigenes of Ifon and Erin-Osun communities. Unfortunately, Mr Taiwo Adetoyese, an indigene of Erin-Osun, has been confirmed dead while the other victim from Alasangbe’s compound Ifon-Osun is responding to treatment. 
“Thereafter, we called the attention of the Osun State Commissioner of Police to further threat by the Ilobu community that they are ready for war by killing our people. Moments later, the security team arrested two armed fighters from the Ilobu community and they were taken to the Headquarters of Osun State Police Command. Consequently, we are experiencing sporadic shootings at the same place where they were arrested.
“The true position is that the police have not mobilised enough personnel to curtail the situation while our people are living with fear. We are appealing to the Osun State Government and security agencies to hold Oba Ashiru Olatoye Olaniyan, The Olobu of Ilobu, responsible for the ongoing crisis that is unsettling the people of Erin-Osun and Ifon-Orolu Kingdom.

But while reacting, the Public Relations Officer, Ilobu Development Union, Tairu Babatunde, accused the Ifon people of sponsoring attacks on Ilobu which has left many people injured and displaced.
“What started like a rumour in the early hours of Wednesday has finally become a reality. People of Ilobu, especially those living at Oke-Ima, Idire, Apiponroro, Ganga, Oke-Awesin and Council Road woke up to a rumour of a planned attack by the Babatunde Oyetunji-led Ifon-Osun, but many ignored as they believed that the crisis that Oyetunji ignited about a month ago has been laid to rest.
“However, against their beliefs, armed thugs who have been identified as people of Ifon-Osun invaded their communities and started shooting sporadically. As of 7 pm on Wednesday, thousands of Ilobu people who are residents of Oke-Ima, Apiponroro, Idire, Council Road, Ganga and Oke Awesin areas have been displaced as armed hoodlums have started shooting at their houses.
“We again call on the security agencies to immediately put an end to this incessant attack on Ilobu by the people of Ifon-Osun. Arresting Oyetunji and Akinyooye will be a perfect beginning to end these unwarranted attacks”, Babatunde said.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/13173709/communal-clash.png

The Governor, who spoke in Ado Ekiti during a reception for the athletes on Wednesday evening, said the incident had strengthened the state government’s resolve to develop sports, and assured the youngsters and their coaches of financial rewards.
Oyebanji said the officials embarrassed the athletes, their parents, Ekiti people at home and abroad and the state generally.
The athletes, described as “Great Ekiti Ambassadors,” won a total of seven medals — two gold, two silver and three bronze — at the Games.


  
Ekiti athletes were kitted in all sorts of unbefitting wears during the march past for the opening of the games in what has been described as an embarrassing situation which went viral and attracted criticisms.
Addressing the athletes, Oyebanji said, “Let me start on the note of apology to you for the indiscretion and the inappropriate behaviour of the officials of the sports council.
“As a government, we tried our best to provide for you, but the officials, for reasons best known to them, decided to act inappropriately. As a government, I accept responsibility for this, not because I support those that decided to act in ways and manners that have brought embarrassment to you and to all Ekiti indigenes all over the world, but as the Governor of Ekiti State.        Related News   Youth Games end today in Asaba  Delta police engage kidnappers in gun duel, kill four  Delta pastor kills girl   
“I apologise to all Ekiti indigenes for the embarrassment caused by the sports council officials to all of us and I hope you accept my apology but I can assure you that justice will be served.”
The Governor, who lauded the young athletes for their “impressive performances”, assured them of government’s support to attain greater heights in their respective areas of specialisation.
He said, “I know you were not well fed there. I have photos of where you slept, but I thank God it happened. If it had not happened, we would not have paid attention to you. In adversities, there are lessons. What happened has strengthened our resolve to reposition sports in the state.”
Oyebanji added that the bill for the establishment of the state’s sports commission recently signed by the state House of Assembly would be passed within two weeks.
He said, “We are going to pay special attention to sports and the vehicle we are going to use is the sports commission, adding that “efforts are in top gear to set up indoor games centres in the state next year.”
The Governor said the Oluyemi Kayode Stadium in Ado Ekiti, as well as other stadia in Ikere, Ijero and Ikole, would soon be given facelift, saying his administration would leave no stone unturned in its quest to maximise the potential of young talents in sports and other fields.
Oyebanji also assured the athletes and coaches at the Youth Games that they would get cash rewards, and hailed his wife, Dr Olayemi Oyebanji and wife of former Governor, Erelu Bisi Fayemi, for their intervention and invaluable contributions towards coming to the aid of the athletes in Asaba.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/07151408/Oyebanji.jpg

The Nigerian had been left furious after two seemingly insulting videos were posted to the club’s TikTok account, one of which had mocked him as begging for a penalty then his miss from the spot in a Serie A match against Bologna at the end of September.
The videos caused an uproar for Osimhen and his supporters alike, eventually leading to the departure of one of Napoli’s social media executives.
Since the incident, Napoli have played three matches and been awarded penalties in every one of those games, yet Osimhen has not taken any of them.

Holmes, who held the world title from 1978 until 1985, was once a Tyson victim when he was knocked out in the fourth round of their title fight in New Jersey January 22, 1988.
Now 73, the International Boxing Hall of Fame and World Boxing Hall of Fame inductee and only man to defeat Muhammad Ali by stoppage, is making a bold claim for Joshua.
Holmes believes that the fellow former champion would have been able to knock Tyson out in his prime.

Tyson (50-6-2, 44 knockouts) is regarded as arguably the greatest fighter in boxing, gaining notoriety for his early knockout wins and intimidating aura.
“If he fought a guy like Mike Tyson, he’d win, he would have knocked out a prime Mike Tyson. There’s no reckon about it. Mike Tyson went down low and then came up and tried to throw roundhouses. But Joshua would just hit him with a straight right hand on the side of his damn chin and Mike wouldn’t get up,” Holmes said.      
“He never fought anyone who was coming up and trying to make their way in the sport. He just went in there – bang, bang, bang and knocked everyone out. That’s how he got the reputation as a puncher.

Strickland shocked the world last time out when he dominated Adesanya to capture the middleweight title. Following his win, there was a wide consensus that ‘The Last Stylebender’ would get an immediate rematch, but that may no longer be the case.
While speaking to the media at the Contender Series press conference on Wednesday, White shed some doubt on the middleweight championship bout.
According to the UFC CEO, another rising challenger in the weight class could force his way into contention.


  
“I mean, that fight (between Strickland and Adesanya) just happened. A couple of fights are going to play out here now over the next month or so and then we’ll go from there and figure out what’s next,” he said.  Related News   Love lost!

“Whatever the best fight to make when all is said and done, and who’s injured, who’s not injured, who can go, what time, where, you know? There’s a lot of different factors that play into what we’re going to do next.”
The middleweight division is stacked with a number of high-level contenders who are all hoping to be called for the next shot at UFC gold. Dricus du Plessis is the obvious standout, beating all six of his opponents inside the octagon.      
Du Plessis was originally meant to meet Adesanya in the cage this year but was replaced with Strickland when he refused the fight date due to injury. The South African may now jump ahead of the rest of the competitors to get his shot at the champion.
There are also some huge matchups set to take place later this year that may shape the future of the division. No.4 ranked Jared Cannonier will welcome Roman Dolidze into the cage in a battle between two powerhouses December 2.
Another fight at middleweight will see Khamzat Chimaev make his return to the weight class when he collides with Paulo Costa later this month. ‘Borz’ has already called out champion Strickland and hopes a win at UFC 294 October 21 secures him a title shot.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/05213655/ADESANYA-AND-STRICKLAND.jpg

Orban has struggled to replicate his last season’s impressive form, having scored two goals in seven appearances this season and has failed to find the back of the net in four consecutive games.
The Nigerian striker’s dip in form has come as a major surprise to many following his near-perfect outing last season.
The Nigerian joined Gent from Stabaek in January and even though he only joined in the middle of the campaign, he scored 20 goals in 22 games — a feat that has seen clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham monitor his progress.

“Things are not going so smoothly with Gift either in training,” he said, as quoted by Nieuwsblad.

Or you have to be new like my neighbor (points to Gandelman, ed.), because then you sometimes have to pick up some things. We also think it’s strange, but I also mentioned that last year: then everything worked and everything was great.

Competitors at the Games, which end on Sunday, publicly say they are more interested in glory than financial gain.
But medals, especially of the gold variety, often come with a windfall that can change the lives of athletes and their families, especially those who are amateurs rather than professionals in their sport.
India doles out $36,000 for gold at the Asian Games, a fortune in a country where tens of millions of people live below the poverty line and the average annual income is $2,380.


  
For some Indian competitors, the even bigger prize is a stable salary — Olympic and Asian Games medallists can have a government job if they want one.
Wrestler Vinesh Phogat was promoted to the rank of a senior railway official after her gold at the Asian Games in Jakarta in 2018, joining fellow wrestlers Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik.
Singapore’s National Olympic Committee awards a $146,000 prize to individual athletes who clinch gold, a hefty sum but barely enough to buy a small flat in the wealthy city-state.      
Indonesia will gift a free home to any Asian Games medallist – as long as they provide the land to build it on.
“For those who have land, we will build houses,” Indonesia’s Asian Games chef de mission Basuki Hadimuljono told local media.
If Kuwaiti gold medallists Abdullah Al-Rashidi and Yaqoub Al-Youha do not already drive, now would be the time to learn.
Because a Kuwaiti businessman has offered to buy a car for those who win gold, with 60-year-old shooter Al-Rashidi set to be gifted a Volvo.
In South Korea, male athletes who win gold at the Games gain exemption from at least 18 months of military service.

It is controversial back home, with one triumphant competitor in Hangzhou declining to talk about it when asked by AFP.
– ‘A relief’ –        
In most countries’ cases, the rewards are cash.
But when asked what it meant to them, athletes at the Games invariably said they were motivated by higher goals than mere material reward.
National pride is the most usual refrain, while Philippine boxing great Felix Marcial is fighting to make his family proud.
“It’s for myself, for my wife, for my country, and for my father, because I’m not here right now if not because of my father,” he told AFP after winning his semi-final on Wednesday.
But there’s no doubt getting a monetary boost can be life-changing for some athletes, especially those from a poor background.
Neeraj Chopra is a world, Olympic and Asian Games champion, but it was not always a gilded life for the Indian javelin great.
After a success in 2017, and before becoming the icon he is today in India, Chopra became a junior commissioned officer in the army.      
“My father is a farmer, mother a housewife… nobody in my family has a government job so everybody is happy,” Chopra said after joining the army.
“For me, it is a sort of a relief because now I am able to help my family financially besides continuing with mytraining.”

World football’s governing body announced on Wednesday that Morocco, Portugal and Spain will jointly host the 2030 showpiece but the opening games will be played in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay to celebrate the tournament’s centenary.
In its original announcement, FIFA only confirmed that Morocco, Portugal and Spain would automatically qualify, but on Thursday it confirmed that the three South American nations would also be spared qualifying.
It means that in a tournament that will have already expanded from 32 teams to 48 teams for the 2026 finals, “three of the six places” attributed to the South American zone in 2030 will be taken, a FIFA spokesman said.

The guaranteed berth for 2030 is especially good news for Paraguay which has failed to qualify for the last three World Cups.
Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay were originally candidates alongside Chile to host the tournament but eventually stood aside in return for the right to host the first three matches and celebrations for the centenary of the World Cup, which was first played in Uruguay’s capital Montevideo in 1930.

The championship, which is sponsored by telecommunications giants MTN, is organised by the Making of Champions, in partnership with the Athletics Federation of Nigeria and the Nigeria School Sports Federation.
The competition, which is spread across three age brackets — the cadets (U-14), youth (U-17) and juniors (U-20), will be held in four cities across the country — Benin City, Ibadan, Uyo and Abuja.
The championship holds from October 12 to 14 in Benin and in Uyo from October 26 to 28. In Ibadan, the MTN CHAMPS takes place from November 9 to 11, while in Abuja it will hold from November 29 to December 1, with the grand final in Abuja slated for December 2.


  
At a press conference held on Wednesday in Lagos, Chief Marketing Officer, MTN, Adia Showo, said the 10 best athletes from the championship would join the MoC Academy and wouldhave the benefit of a structured training schedule, which would teach them the importance of discipline, time management and life skills.

Ndidi, who is enjoying a new lease of life in the English Championship playing under manager Enzo Maresca, is yet to sign a new deal at Leicester City and could from January 1, 2024, agree to join another club on a free transfer next summer.
According to football transfer expert, Ekrem Konur, Brighton are planning a move for the defensive midfielder, who has been flourishing in his new No.8 role at Leicester City.
The Nigerian midfielder had an assist and won the Player of The Match award after posting an outstanding performance in Leicester’s 4-1 win at Blackburn Rovers last Sunday to extend the Foxes lead at the top of the Championship table.


  
He was linked with another Premier League outfit, Nottingham Forest, on a deadline of the last summer transfer window but the deal fell through after the Tricky Trees completed a deal for Ibrahim Sangare instead.

When asked if contracts were in the offing, Maresca said at a press conference on Wednesday, “No. At this moment, we are focused on our season, our games. We have time to see it and decide. In this moment, the priority is not that.”      
Players whose contracts expire next summer are Jamie Vardy, Marc Albrighton, Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Dennis Praet and Alex Smithies.

The 26-year-old, who has made a positive start since joining Forest on a free transfer from Torino last summer, received 40 per cent of the total votes cast on the club’s website.
Reacting to his award, the defender thanked the fans for their support in a post on his Instagram story page.
“Thanking the fans for their support. I did a thing, thank you for the support.”


  
Aina, who succeeded compatriot, Taiwo Awoniyi, who won the award in August, played three times for the Tricky Trees in the month under review and helped Steve Cooper’s side gain four points from a possible nine.

The Nigerian joined Ge...",5th October 2023,https://punchng.com/can-orban-end-goals-drought/,Johnny Edward,"Gent’s impressive run towards the end of last season offered so much optimism in large part because of Gift Orban’s outstanding goalscoring form, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.
The Nigerian joined Gent from Stabaek in January and even though he only joined in the middle of the campaign, he scored 20 goals in 22 games — a feat that has seen clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham monitor his progress.
Orban became the mainstay of Gent’s attack last season as they qualified for the UEFA Conference League and his rich vein of form left many with the feeling that another similar season would be ahead of the Nigerian.
This season, though, has so far been a sharp contrast from the last for Orban, who has only found the back of the next six times from 12 in all competitions — two in seven league games — and has failed to score in his last four games in all competitions.


  
Despite Orban’s dip in form, Gent are unbeaten in the Belgian Jupilier league this season with five wins and four draws from their opening nine games and they sit second in the table behind leaders Union Saint Gilloise.
The 21-year-old made a return from his two-match suspension in Gent’s 1-1 draw away at RWD Molenbeek last Sunday and was largely anonymous in the game — a display that saw his coach Hein Vanhaezebrouck raise concerns about the current form of his most prized asset.
“He is the top scorer after all,” Vanhaezebrouck said of Orban.        Related News   UCL: Unfortunate Meret hands Madrid win at Napoli  Madrid vs Napoli: Osimhen eyes 65th Napoli goal  Madrid plot Boniface summer move   
“We created many chances, but not when he came on. That also means something. You also have to be able to create your chances. We barely saw him (Orban). You have that as a striker. You have periods when every ball falls well, but not now. Our crosses were not good enough either. Previously he was always in the right place. The efficiency was not there. We are having a hard time scoring.”
Orban’s last goal came in August against Sint Truiden and former goalkeeper Dosu Joseph believes the striker can end his drought against Maccabi Tel Aviv on Thursday.
“Every striker goes through a dry spell and it depends on how individuals manage to overcome them,”Dosu told PUNCH Sports Extra.
“We all saw recently, how Osimhen shut his critics up with his goals after playing some games without scoring. For Orban, his team will need to play to his strength like they had been doing to help him end his drought.”
Football agent, Ayo Makinwa, also shares Dosu’s thoughts on Orban.
“He needs to be patient and the coach needs to make him more confidence, that he is the main man at the club, again. He made his first appearance last weekend after some weeks out and I believe it will put him in good shape against Maccabi Tel Aviv.”

He also did not feature at the 2023 Belgian International Classics and the 2023 Peru Challenge.
“I would have loved to play at the classics in Guatemala and Peru but it didn’t happen because of issues with my transit visa,” Opeyori said.

Bayer Leverkusen will travel to Molde on Thursday for their Europa League match-day two encounter.
Boniface has a good knowledge of Erling Moe’s side having come up against them several times during his time in Norway with Bodo/Glimt.
The 22-year-old is expecting a difficult game against the modest side.


  
“Molde are one of the top teams in the Norwegian league and they compete for the title year after year,” Boniface told the club’s official website.

The NPFL announced on Tuesday that they had acquired test kits for doping from the United Kingdom, while also giving the clubs and players a two-week notice.
“We are committed to joining the NFF, CAF, FIFA and the global campaign for eradication of illicit substance use in sports and this will commence soon with random tests of our players”, IMC chairman, Gbenga Elegbeleye, told npfl.com.ng.
On Wednesday, the league body also posted an infographic on its X account stating, “NPFL players say no to doping.”


  
However, some experts have questioned the move by the NPFL, especially as it concerns the modality of carrying out the exercise, which they say is not supposed to be a one-off.
A drug in sports and physical activity expert, Jimi Osinaike, noted that the announcement was vague.
He stated, “Good development. Some key issues that need clarity: are NPFL players well educated on which substances are prohibited? How often will players be tested? Will there be in and out of competition testing? Is the league management financially capable to analyse the samples?”      
In a chat with The PUNCH, another expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it would take a lot of steps to align the testing with the CAF/FIFA standards as well as training of personnel.  Related News   FIFA best awards  FIFA appoints referees, VAR officials for Super Eagles, Saudi Arabia friendly  FIFA to hold 2030 World Cup across three continents, six countries   
“There are only three laboratories in Africa that are doing doping control testing and none of them are in West Africa. The number one laboratory is Switzerland, so, how do you send samples?,” he queried.
“When you say random, nothing is random in doping control, it is planned. And that is in the number of players you will select, not in the number of tests you will do. You need a minimum of one doctor in each NPFL venue on each day. And generally, FIFA announces two players for each team, making four.
“When you also say train, you don’t train people for doping control overnight, you first get the doctors or nurses and do integrity assessments for them. It takes weeks or months to train them on how to handle samples and you need doping control chaperons. The league has suggested this before without doing anything eventually, and they are now making the same arbitrary statement again.”
Meanwhile, the announcement immediately sparked reactions from followers of the league, who believe the move will indeed keep the perceived use of performance-enhancing drugs by the players in check.
“A lot of Nigerian players might fail the test anyways, a good development in the NPFL,” Keny David wrote on X.
Another follower, Okhueleigbe Aigbokhaebho, suggested that the unchecked act has caused many of the players not to perform when they eventually move abroad.        
“A very welcome development if you ask me. It’s difficult for a handful of our lads to get used to this as a routine when they make their way to Europe.”
“I hope many of the Nigerian local professional football players won’t be caught in the loophole of this. Many of them smoke weed and drink different kinds of substances,” Ismail Omobolaji claimed on X.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/29175234/image9.jpg

Nigeria are hosts of the first edition of the series at the Tafawa Balewa Cricket Oval, Lagos, and Tikolo’s men had the honour of facing the East African invitees in the opening game.
The Yellow Greens returned to action for the first time in almost a year on a winning note in the first game of the series by defeating Rwanda by 54 runs.
Having not played any competitive international game this year, Nigeria won the toss and captain Sylvester Okpe elected to bat first, setting the tone for a thrilling first innings in which the Rwandans gave them a good run for their money with some spin bowling.


  
After dropping five wickets midway through their batting, the Yellow Greens controlled the game firmly and posted 127 runs for the loss of eight wickets in 20 overs for the Rwandans to chase in the second innings.

The East Africans started their batting slowly and were eventually restricted to 73 runs all out in 18.2 overs as Nigeria grabbed the win, with Chiemelie Udekwe also clinching the man-of-the-match award for his three wickets, 14 runs and one maiden.
Regardless of the win, Tikolo said the team still had work to do especially with their batting.      
“Batting is a department where you need to keep playing more and more, so, yes there was rustiness,” Tikolo told The PUNCH.
“We lost about five wickets in the middle period, which should not be happening. But it’s good that we’ve got the first game out of the way, it went in our favour, so now the boys just need to know what to do in the upcoming games. Momentum is gathering, when you win your first game, it gives you a lot of confidence going into the coming games,” he said.

The 29-year-old, who joined the Turkish club on a season-long loan from Southampton, admitted that it was easy adjusting to football in Turkey because he was desperate to prove himself again, after a slow start to his career at Saint Marys.
The Nigerian failed to find the net in 12 games nor make a goal contribution for the Saints as they suffered relegation to the English Championship last season.
But after a bright start to his Trabzonspor career, the former Genk striker is confident of continuing his hot streak after setting a new record at the club last weekend.


  
Onuachu’s goal against Pendikspor last Saturday saw him enter into the history books of the club as the first player to score in his first three Super Lig matches after the 2007/08 season for Trabzonspor.
The strike was his 167th club career goal, having played for KRC Genk, Midtjylland, Vejle Boldklub, Southampton and Trabzonspor.  Related News   Onuachu plays down injury fears after debut goal  Onuachu set for career revival at Trabzonspor  Trabzonspor pay €1.5m loan fee for Onuachu

“Everybody here played a big role in making me settle in and I just want to give my best to the team and help them win games and make the fans happy as well.
“It was not easy at the start of the year but I’m happy to have begun my career on a good note here at Trabzonspor and I want to keep improving and in every game and prove again that I have it.”
Onuachu, according to several reports took a massive wage cut to make the move to Trabzonspor, after they agreed to pay €1.5m in two instalments for the Nigerian.
The former Genk striker, who was the top scorer in Belgium two seasons ago, will be eager to make it four goals from four games when Trabzonspor face Adana Demirspor in a Super Lig game on Friday.
Trabzonspor have won three of their last four matches and are currently fifth with 12 points from seven games. A win will see them move above third-place Adana Dermirspor, who have 14 points from the same number of games.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/12203322/Onuachu.jpg

The Rwandans suffered a 54-run defeat in the hands of the Yellow Greens on Wednesday, despite showing some flashes with their bowling in the first innings of the game.
Nigeria survived the scare and posted 128 runs for the loss of eight wickets in 20 overs in the first innings, but Lee Booth’s men could not chase down the run in the second innings, managing 73 runs all out in 18.2 overs.
Rwanda’s impressive bowling left them with something to be proud of, as Rukiriza Emile got three wickets and 13 runs, just one run shy of Nigeria’s Chiemelie Udekwe, who won the man-of-the-match award.

De Laurentiis spoke to Spanish TV programme El Chiringuito on Tuesday night following a 3-2 loss to Real Madrid in the Champions League. Despite the defeat, De Laurentiis was happy with the performance of his players.
“Real Madrid are still very strong, they play really well,” he said.
“Carlo Ancelotti is a friend. I didn’t see him because I didn’t want to disturb him before the game, now he’ll be celebrating. We’ll meet again in Madrid. However, I am satisfied with my team. They were competitive.”


  
A part of the Madrid fanbase is unhappy with results and performances under Ancelotti, but De Laurentiis defended his ex-coach.
“Fans want to win and when they don’t they always criticise, but someone like Ancelotti can’t be criticised as a man, a coach or a footballer.”  Related News   Peseiro faces strikers selection headache  Napoli vs Real Madrid: Osimhen is very dangerous - Ancelotti  Madrid vs Napoli: Osimhen eyes 65th Napoli goal   
De Laurentiis was asked his thoughts on Osimhen’s performance against Madrid and whether he will extend his contract with Napoli.      
“Osimhen is always strong, there are no doubts about him,” said De Laurentiis.
“New contract? Yes, there is no problem. There is never a problem. Everyone is always happy at Napoli. It’s their (players’) problem when they leave because they no longer find their path.”
Osimhen has been in talks over a new deal with the Partenopei for several months but has still not reached an agreement. His contract expires in June 2025.

The government also said that it would avoid food imports by enhancing its ability to produce adequate food for its citizens.

The Minister of Information and National Orientation, Mohammed Idris, according to a statement issued on Wednesday night by the Deputy Director of Press, Suleiman Haruna, stated these during a courtesy visit by the Ambassador of the Republic of Belarus, His Excellency Vyacheslav Bril.

“With the availability of arable land, human resources, and a large market, what is lacking is technology and the necessary investment in the value chain.One of the key priority areas for President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is food security, which he declared an emergency from day one because it is the only way to curb food importation and strengthen our economy. Nigeria wants to avoid food imports by enhancing its ability to produce adequate food for its citizens”, Idris told his guest, adding that the Republic of Belarus has technology and expertise in Agriculture from which Nigeria could tap.

The Minister assured the Ambassador that Nigeria was ready to partner in that regard.

“I am happy that you are already partnering with the Ministry of Agriculture so that our two countries can work together to boost food production”, he said.

Earlier in his remarks, the Envoy said that the Republic of Belarus is export-oriented and strong in Agriculture.

“For example, the Republic of Belarus is responsible for almost 30 per cent of fertilizer production, which is very important for food security in the world”,
Bril emphasized.

Belarus, he said, has had long and fruitful relations with Nigeria since 1992.

“We can support Nigeria with farm inputs, food processing plants, storage facilities, and different kinds of equipment”, Bril added.

Belarus is strong in terms of mechanization of Agriculture, and Belarusian tractors are well-known for their durability around the world",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/25075514/Mallam-Mohammed-Idris.jpg

Miguel Almiron, Dan Burn, Sean Longstaff, and Fabian Schar scored the goals as Newcastle made their first home game in Europe’s elite competition for 20 years a night to remember.








Eddie Howe’s men move to the top of what is considered the toughest Champions League group in this season’s draw.
Newcastle have four points from their opening two games, one more than PSG, while Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan picked up their first point in a 0-0 draw in Germany.


  
The first ever clash between the clubs pitted the sporting interests of Saudi Arabia and Qatar head-to-head.
A Saudi takeover two years ago has transformed Newcastle’s fortunes in similar fashion to how the influx of cash from the Middle East has made PSG the dominant force of French football over the past decade.
PSG boss Luis Enrique warned before the game that Newcastle were the side no one wanted from the fourth pot of seeds and the Premier League side showed why.      
Despite being acutely aware of Newcastle’s threat, Luis Enrique boldly stuck with a star-studded front four featuring Kylian Mbappe, Ousmane Dembele, Goncalo Ramos and Randal Kolo Muani.  Related News   UCL: Torres scrapes Barca throughat Porto  UCL: Alvarez and Doku strike late to push City past Leipzig  Madrid vs Napoli: Osimhen eyes 65th Napoli goal   
It could have been very different for the French champions had Dembele’s sweetly-struck volley form Mbappe’s cross found the net rather than flying inches wide early on.
But once the home side, roared on by a raucous 52,000 fans, got their claws into the visitors, they did not let go.
PSG were though architects of their own downfall with the opening goal on 17 minutes.
A slack pass by Marquinhos was intercepted by Bruno Guimaraes to give Alexander Isak a clear sight of goal.
Gianluigi Donnarummaproduced a fine save to deny the Swede, but Almiron was on hand to curl into the far corner.

Barca midfielder Gavi was sent off in stoppage time for a second yellow card as the Catalans clung on desperately to secure victory.
Xavi selected youngster Lamine Yamal on the right wing, making him the youngest starter in Champions League history at 16 years and 83 days.
The teenager showed some bright sparks in the first half but largely Porto were on top, cutting through a Barcelona midfield shorn of the injured Pedri and Frenkie de Jong.


  
Barcelona holding midfielder Oriol Romeu endured a tough night, with Porto harrying him at every possible moment, roared on by a packed Dragao stadium.
Brought in from Girona to replace Sergio Busquets, the job is proving a big one for the former Southampton and Chelsea man to handle.
He was fortunate to avoid a yellow card in the first half but his team-mates Joao Cancelo, Ronald Araujo and Gavi went into the book — along with coach Xavi.        Related News   Newcastle thrash PSG on memorable Champions League homecoming  UCL: Alvarez and Doku strike late to push City past Leipzig  Madrid vs Napoli: Osimhen eyes 65th Napoli goal   
Mehdi Taremi appealed for a penalty early on after Jules Kounde took a handful of his shirt in the area but it would have been soft.
At the other end Joao Felix was involved in Barcelona’s best attacking moments, to a cacophony of whistles from Porto fans who had not forgotten his Benfica past.
The Eagles beat Porto in the Portuguese Clasico last week, which Felix said would only motivate his old rivals even further.
However Porto midfielder Romario Baro lost concentration just before half-time and it proved costly for his side, who had more than held their own.
Romario’s under-hit pass was easily stolen by Ilkay Gundogan, who threaded through Torres.
The Spanish forward, who replaced injured hitman Robert Lewandowski earlier in the first half, rolled home a low strike under Diogo Costa.

The party however said it will welcome any interest that amplifies its quest for a nation where true justice shall reign.
The response was a reaction to the call by the PDP candidate for Obi and the presidential flag bearer of the New Nigeria People’s Party, Rabiu Kwankwaso, to join his crusade in exposing the alleged dirty secrets of the president.
In a statement released in Abuja on Wednesday by the National Publicity Secretary of LP, Obiora Ifoh, the party appealed that they would appreciate if their candidate is allowed to concentrate on his case at the apex court.

politics,Why Amaechi hijacked Rivers APC — Ex-aide,"Tony Okocha, a former Chief of Staff to the immediate past Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has called on the National Chairman of All Progressives Congress, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, to ignore...",6th October 2023,https://punchng.com/why-amaechi-hijacked-rivers-apc-ex-aide/,Adebayo Folorunsho-Francis,"Tony Okocha, a former Chief of Staff to the immediate past Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has called on the National Chairman of All Progressives Congress, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, to ignore overtures from loyalists of the former governor, saying they worked against the presidential ambition of President Bola Tinubu.
The APC chieftain made the call when he led a delegation of party chieftains from Rivers State to the APC national headquarters in Abuja on Thursday.
His admonition is coming two weeks after Rivers APC governorship candidate, Tonye Cole, informed Ganduje they were displeased with the manner the president appointed former Governor Nyesom Wike and some card-carrying members of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party into his cabinet.
While lamenting that their loyal supporters don’t deserve to be left in the cold, Cole had reassured the APC National Working Committee they are ready for reconciliation, provided the president compensates some of their ‘sons and daughters’ with key positions in his administration. 
But Okocha, an ally of Wike, kicked against the move, insisting that their overture smacks of sinister motives.
Addressing journalists in Abuja, the APC chieftain said none of Amaechi’s loyalists deserve to be given appointment or attention, following the manner they hijacked the state chapter of the party and worked against the presidential ambition of Tinubu.
He said, “Amaechi with the consent of his chief lieutenants (who visited the chairman a fortnight ago), made a decision to contest the presidential primary election of the APC. In their campaigns, they threw to the dust, every sense of civility and made disparaging and unutterable aspersions against Tinubu. Nigerians saw the dramatic official declaration of Amaechi at the Adokie Amiesimaka stadium in Port Harcourt.      
“Flanked by Cole, Dakuku et al, he ran around the stadium to prove fitness and show off Tinubu as physically unfit, frail, and incapable. This was followed by sponsored social media jabs from their media-savvy supporters and some hirelings, who inundated the new media handles with unprintable and unspeakable spews, graphics and concoctions. On one breath, Tinubu was shown on graphics, wearing diapers as one who defecates/urinates on self, as caused by an ailment. On the other, Tinubu was graphically sketched on a medical stretcher as one too old and on a departure lounge. A few of us, who believed in Asiwaju, were carefully isolated and audaciously ostracised from the party. Yet we met them grit to grit.
“By the party guidelines, APC Rivers had 69 delegates. All the delegates were mobilised to Abuja with handouts. All the 69 delegates from Rivers State, emptied their votes into Amaechi’s box. The APC Presidential Primary, which was adjudged as fair and credible, threw up a winner in Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Asiwaju now a candidate visited all those who aspired with him, to seek friendship, support and cooperation to move the party forward. Amaechi, the leader of Cole, Dakuku et al, was visited by the candidate himself, not by proxy. Did they accede to the honest request of the candidate? Hell No!  Related News   Atiku's press conference gross contempt of Supreme Court — APC  Tribunal: Nasarawa APC rejects Sule's sack  Tinubu’s credentials: APC lampoons Atiku, ex-VP set to submit documents in S’Court   
“In Rivers state, hostilities against Asiwaju as candidate of APC mounted even more, unashamedly. No campaign was staged by the party in Rivers state, for her presidential candidate nor was Tinubu’s candidacy mentioned in any of their campaign rallies in the 23 Local Government Areas.
No billboard. No backdrop at campaign venues. Only two out of the 15 candidates for the House of Representatives, shared campaign posters with Tinubu’s picture or sign. The two who did were so bashed and seen as betrayals.”
Continuing, Okocha urged the APC national chairman to discountenance the ‘machinations of the pretenders’ who are planning to negate the natural law that aptly recommends that one reaps where the one sows.
“Those persons never supported the party nor are they sincere in their hearts, to be happy that President Tinubu made it to the Presidency.
“Mr. Chairman, we summarise that the only group in APC Rivers State legitimate to seek compensation for the victory of APC and Tinubu in Rivers State is the one here,” he said.
While welcoming the delegation, Ganduje cautioned against fuelling the internal party crisis in Rivers at a time when he is seeking reconciliation.        
According to him, he was familiar with the genesis of the acrimony and working hard to bring back aggrieved chieftains and members who defected to opposition parties back to the fold.
He said, “Whatever it is, we have received your address and the party will come in and see how we can get a solid party leadership so that we can move forward. But what we are begging is not to overheat the system. Overheating the system, some will go for litigation and then a vicious cycle will come again. We don’t want too much analysis because they say too much analysis leads to paralysis.
“There is no doubt River state is a very important state in Nigeria, an oil state and also a reasonable population. Population is an asset for election and is an asset to any political party. So you can see how we can not rubbish the state, Rivers as a state in politics is a very important state. I welcome you and I listen to you with akeeninterest.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/02221631/Rotimi-Amaechi.jpg

This was disclosed in a reaction issued by the National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Felix Morka, on Thursday.
Morka stated that the ruling APC was unfazed by the media briefing by the former VP, stressing that it lacked purpose and delivered nothing except the pitiful regurgitation of lies, mindless distortions and deliberate falsehood on Atiku’s infantile obsession with the academic record of the president.
He said, “For several weeks now, Nigerians and the world have watched with incredulity Alhaji Abubakar’s display of utter desperation in his failed bid to become the President of Nigeria. Earlier today, he put his desperation in overdrive during his press conference where he addressed some of the issues in his appeal at the Supreme Court and bandied unproven charges against the President of Nigeria, His Excellency Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in a calculated attempt to shamelessly whip up public sentiments and inordinately pressure the Supreme Court.  Related News   Chicago varsity record: After US expedition, Presidential poll battle returns to Supreme Court  Why Amaechi hijacked Rivers APC — Ex-aide  Tribunal: Nasarawa APC rejects Sule's sack   
“We believe Atiku should have known better than to demonstrate gross contempt of the highest court by making public comments on a matter that he has submitted to the court for adjudication. The major takeaway from his Yar’Adua Centre show, especially at question time, was that Atiku harbours deep animosity towards Tinubu whom he believes was responsible for his electoral woes in 2007, 2015, 2019 and this year.
Morka added, “In desperation, unbecoming of a statesman who once occupied the second highest office in the land, the PDP candidate in the last election has thrown every decency, decorum, dignity and national respectability out the window on his purposeless judicial voyage of discovery to the United States in search of a magic wand for taking power against the will of the Nigerian electorate loudly expressed in last February’s presidential election.”
“It should now be clear to all Nigerians that despite Atiku’s lies before the Illinois Court that he wanted to use the discoveries in pursuit of his appeal at the Supreme Court, he has rather chosen to use same as an instrument of mischief and blackmail in clear contempt of the highest court of the land. We want to urge him to graciously accept his defeat and quietly lick his political wound with some dignity. Nigerians rejected him at the polls, and he cannot get by subterfuge what he failed to get through theballotbox.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/21150604/APC-National-Publicity-Secretary-Mr-Felix-Morka.jpg

Otti had urged the incumbent governor, Hope Uzodimma, during a Labour Party campaign in Owerri, Imo State capital, to start preparing his handover note before his imminent defeat at the poll.
Addressing a press conference in Abuja, Shuaibu insisted that Otti will not be welcomed ahead of the Imo governorship election because his presence could spark violence in the state and scare away voters.
He said, “It is our duty to speak truth to power and we shall continue to do so until sanity is restored to all levels of governance in Nigeria. It is necessary to draw the attention of Nigerians towards the activities of the Abia State Governor, Alex Otti, who is set to invade Imo State with some members of the Labour Party for the Imo State gubernatorial elections. 
“Otti’s mission in Imo is to sponsor violence in the gubernatorial election so that voters will flee in favour of the Labour Party’s candidate. How can a newly elected governor who is yet to acclimatize himself with his office openly declare that the workaholic governor of Imo State should prepare his handover note?

In most part of the country, elections are made to be a do-or-die affair with political actors willing to do anything to secure their seats but men of good conscience always stand to advocate for peaceful elections. Such are leaders of thought who believe in Nigeria.”
Continuing, Shuaibu warned politicians and elder statesmen not to make unguarded statements, which he observed is already building up tension ahead of the November 11 poll.      
“In Imo State, some senior citizens are calling for war with their unguarded statements which is already building up tension ahead of the poll. Mr President must remember his statement that he won’t interfere in any democratic process anywhere in the county. Therefore, the president must caution the governor of Abia State against statements that are capable of causing crisis and not to meddle in the affairs of other states. 
“If the election is free and fair, Governor Hope Uzodinma will cruise to victory as his works speak for him. The APC-led government of Imo State has shown clearly the difference between good governance and maladministration and it would be wrong to fold our arms and watch a governor from another state cause chaos in Imo State.”
“For Governor Otti and his co-travellers, the plan to change the political leadership in Imo State come November 11 will fail just like the plan to surrender South East to unknown gunmen also failed. Governor Hope Uzodinma has stood firm with his people in ensuring that security is provided by the Federal Government, his effort is commendable and he deserves re-election,” he said.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/04084720/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-04-at-8.46.53-AM.jpg

The tribunal had on Monday sacked Sule and directed the Independent National Electoral Commission to withdraw his Certificate of Return and issue the same to the winner of the 2023 governorship election in the state, David Ombugadu of the Peoples Democratic Party.
Reacting to the development at the APC secretariat in Lafia on Wednesday, the state Chairman of the party, Aliyu Bello, said the party believes that the tribunal committed a monumental error in declaring the PDP candidate as the winner of the governorship election in the state.
The Nasarawa APC further lamented that the facts and arguments presented by its legal team and that of INEC against the petition filed by Ombugadu and the PDP were overwhelming and incontrovertible, and wondered how the tribunal arrived at its decision. 
The party, therefore, expressed its full support for governor Abdullahi Sule’s decision to appeal against the verdict of the tribunal, while assuring him of their complete loyalty throughout the legal processes.

Our great party therefore, unequivocally, and categorically rejects the split judgment of the Tribunal of two to one annulling the re-election of His Excellency, Abdullahi Sule, for a second term, as the Executive Governor of Nasarawa state.
“We identify ourselves with the dissenting judgment which is firmly rooted in law, facts and logic. This further strengthened
our resolve to pursue the appeal.

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday in Lokoja, the state leader of the SDP, Alhaji Hassan Enape, said that there was no iota of truth in the APC position to the effect that the victim was shot by the party loyalists.
According to him, “Rather, APC thugs waylaid party supporters on their way to the palace of the Ohimege Igu, Konto-Nkarfe and destroyed the chairs and canopies erected to host SDP supporters and proceeded to the campaign ground shooting sporadically into the air when a bullet from their pump action guns hit the young lady.”
He also denied that the party’s governorship candidate, Muritala Ajaka, was moving around with thugs in police uniforms. 
“Our security personnel were legitimately assigned to our principal from the office of the Inspector General of Police and can be verified by the Commissioner of Police instead of describing them as fake. There is no single plain-clothed security personnel in the SDP’s entourage, we do not harbour thugs”
Enape said that the party does not believe that the Kogi State police command will be able to provide a level playing ground during the November 11 governorship election in the state.

“This is because of the lies they have been peddling about our principal that he didn’t obtain permission for the rally to hold when in actual fact a subsisting court order has expressly stated that Ajaka should not respond to any police invitation”.      
In his reaction, however, the state APC campaign council said that “it is not out of place, that after exposing the murderous campaign of the SDP in our World Press Conference yesterday, they are expected to come out to defend themselves”.
The Director, Media and publicity of the campaign council, Kingsley Fanwo, said that their response “shows the tactless, lacklustre approach of the ill-prepared desperate politician”.
He said that the police have released their preliminary reports and the SDP candidate should honour the invitation of security agencies to explain why his thugs killed the innocent Kotonkarfe woman and left the entire community mourning.
“While explaining the blood on his hands, he can as well give evidence of his recent claims to the Police and other law enforcement agencies. His macabre dance on the grave of an innocent woman won’t save him. He has murdered sleep and has a date with the rule of law.

Barely one month after he took over the mantle of leadership of Kano State, Governor Abba Yusuf made several headlines when he went on a demolition spree, mowing down properties and business centres whose construction he suspected didn’t follow due process.
Although the governor claimed he was merely fulfilling the promise he made to the people in his manifesto, his action was largely viewed as a deliberate act to destroy any legacy left behind by his predecessor.
Yusuf was however sacked from office on September 20 by the state Election Petitions Tribunal, which affirmed the APC candidate, Nasiru Gawuna, as winner of the March 18 governorship election. 
Receiving a delegation of Kano market youth leaders at the APC national secretariat on Tuesday, Ganduje, who was the immediate governor of the state, reassured the business community that sanity would be restored in the ancient city once the ruling party regained control of the state.
He said: “It is unfortunate for the other issue that you raised. The issue of senseless demolition was unfortunate.That was very unfortunate. They destroyed the economy of Kano. They destroyed business and trading in Kano.
“Many people are now sceptical about going to Kano for business. Even banks don’t accept certificates of occupancy, because they are not sure whether the certificate will be revoked tomorrow. Or even when you build, it will be demolished.      
“You can see the extent of demolition of businesses in Kano. It is very unfortunate. But I have to congratulate you for taking the right steps. People who lost their property in Kano have taken the issue to court. And the court has already started giving verdicts for compensation. It is just the starting point for the people who take them to court. The answer to Kano politics is for the return of the APC and we are pursuing that.”  Related News   Ganduje ungrateful, inconsistent, says NNPP  I may marry four women offered me for returning missing N19m – Kano man  Don’t insult Kwankwaso, NNPP tells Ganduje   
Earlier in his speech, Chairman of the market leaders, Umar Ladiyo, recalled the untold hardship suffered by the business community in the last four months, saying the destruction of property and business centres by the NNPP-led government had forced many business owners into bankruptcy.
The market leader however stated they were happy at the September 20 judgment, which affirmed Gawuna as the actual winner.
“With the outgoing government in Kano, everybody knows what happened was a tragedy. The destruction of properties, businesses and many people have been thrown into crises. Some even lost their lives.
“The amount of money lost in Kano during the destruction was huge. The turnover that is being done is more than N2bn every day. Sadly, we have lost all that now,” he stated.
Continuing, Ladiyo reminded the APC governorship candidate in the state to fulfil his promise to reallocate property to the victims of the NNPP administration destruction.
He said, “We are happy that during the trial at the tribunal, the APC candidate promised that when the APC government comes, all the property destroyed would be reallocated and some people would be helped with some token to start up their businesses. So many people have been thrown into debt and some have even lost their lives.        
“We came here to express our sadness on that. And we pray that when a new government comes, that promise should be fulfilled because it is going to be the first agenda of our government when thetimecomes.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20233212/GANDUJE.jpg

In the contest leading to the emergence of Akpabio as the Senate President, former Zamfara State governor, Abdulaziz Yari, a first-time senator, threw in his weight to vie for the position.
The Senate rule book states that nomination for presiding officers shall be in accordance with the ranking of senators. 
It states, “In determining the ranking, the following Order shall apply: (i) senators returning based on the number of times re-elected; (ii) senators who had been members of the House of Representatives and (iii) Senators elected as senators for the first time.”

This request comes barely 48 hours after Tinubu announced measures to cushion the pains of fuel subsidy removal on Nigerians.
The lawmakers insisted that the law frowns on extra-budgetary spending.
The committee chairman, who commended Tinubu for the CNG initiative, however, warned that it would be illegal to spend taxpayers’ money or money without approval by the National Assembly and other projects in the gas value chain, which is cheaper than the use of fossil fuel. 
The senators also advised against extra-budgetary expenditure through Ways and Means,’ saying the legislature was ready to support and bring succour to the people.
Jarigbe commended Tinubu on his CNG revolution to power vehicles.
He said, “The noble initiative will ameliorate the hardship of the citizens.      
“Also, the President needs to come up with a supplementary budget to enable the government to fund the gas value chain, including the provision for CNG infrastructure and CNG vehicles, and the workshops and training would need to be funded.

Jarigbe stated that the National Assembly, under the leadership of the Senate President, Senator Godswill Akpabio, was poised to support the lofty programs of his administration, adding that a 2023 supplementary budget would be most appropriate, instead of the ‘Ways and Means’ approach of the previous administration, which is currently a major issue of contention in the Central Bank of Nigeria.
In his Independence speech, the President explained that he would ensure that the hardship of Nigerians was alleviated.
He said he was working towards, “A Nigeria where hunger, poverty and hardship are pushed into the shadows of an ever fading past.
“We have opened a new chapter in public transportation through the deployment of cheaper, safer CNG buses across the nation. These buses will operate at a fraction of current fuel prices, positively affecting transport fares.

The governor also dedicated his victory to God and his predecessor, the current Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike.

Fubara stated this while speaking at a brief thanksgiving service held at the Chapel of Everlasting Grace, Government House, Port Harcourt on Monday night. 
A statement issued on Tuesday morning by the media aide to the governor, Boniface Onyedi, said the service was attended by some members of the State Executive Council and political leaders.
Fubara restated his commitment not to disappoint the expectations of Rivers people during his administration.
He explained that the place of God in his administration would not be compromised, saying this explained why they had gathered to thank Him for his unceasing direction and guidance, which made his emergence as governor possible at the polls that has now been affirmed by the tribunal.      

“No matter how brief it is, it is just to say thank you to God our Father, thank you to God His Son and thank you to the Holy Spirit who directs and guides us.
“And to also say that God will always pass through somebody to make things happen.

Cole also faulted one of the grounds of the tribunal that the party in the state had hitherto withdrawn from the matter.
He stated, “I really will like to see what the judges stood on to make their decisions.        
“The main case that the APC withdrew and as a result of that my own rights were infringed upon, I don’t agree with that. The law allows me to continue with the case up to the Supreme Court.”
Similarly, the deputy governorship candidate of the LP, Sam Kinane, said,” We won’t end it here. We will not be able to let Nigerians feel the pain of the robbing that was done in the elections.
“One thing I keep telling people whether we get the kind of justice that we expected or not, if we do not take the matter to court, it would say, ‘yes we were waiting but they did not come.’”
Continuing, he said, “Now that we have taken it to the court and have showed every available evidence they have come with nullification. So, we are still going to take it to the Supreme Court and let’s also hear from them.”

The tribunal had sacked Kano Governor, Abba Yusuf, on September 20 and affirmed the candidate of APC, Nasiru Gawuna, as winner of the contentious March 18 governorship election.
The London demonstration led by a chieftain of the NNPP, Dr Aminu Bello, took place in front of Nigeria’s Embassy.
The eight-man procession converged at the embassy on Sunday morning chanting solidarity songs and displaying different placards that read “Kano must not be robbed”, “Tinubu should allow Justice to prevail in Kano” and “Keep politics out of our courts” among others. 
Reacting, some chieftains of the APC under the aegis of National Coalition of APC Progressives Stakeholders described the demonstration as a cheap attempt to blackmail the judiciary, especially on a day the nation is celebrating its 63rd Independence Day anniversary.

She said, “After failed attempts to discredit the tribunal ruling, the NNPP desperation took them to London where it sponsored a protest to blackmail the Federal Government and discredit the tribunal judgement, unknowingly to the organisers, Nigerians in the diaspora had watched clips of the jubilation that trailed the APC victory at the tribunal thereby Nigerians in London ignored the sponsored protest.      
“It is shameful that Abba Yusuf and the Kwankwasiyya Movement only got eight persons for a protest which targeted about one thousand people, a sign that Nigerians both at home and in Diaspora accepted the judgment in good faith. The NNPP should be aware that, the judiciary can not be intimidated by its threat as security agencies in Nigeria are fully prepared to secure the Country. The eight people led by Dr Aminu Bello who embarrassed themselves yesterday in London do not represent the interest of Nigerians.
“It is barbaric and indeed archaic for the NNPP to toe the part of blackmail calling for justice in faraway London when justice has already been served with the judgment of the tribunal. It is unpalatable to speak ill of the judiciary because your stealing antics were uncovered. It is by such actions that some desperate politicians may desist from rigging and instilling violence during elections.

The minister said that Mbah’s initiative to commence the reconstruction and dualisation of the Enugu – Abakaliki federal road up to the Ebonyi boundary was another display of people-driven leadership by a private sector person in governance.      
He added, “I am happy that you came from the private sector. There is a very serious high hope by the steps you have rolled out. They are in tandem with Mr. President’s steps and I pledge to support him very seriously and I also pledge to support you. There must be a change. We must reset the country.

The chieftain also congratulated his deputy, Noimot Oyedele-Salako, the state chapter of APC and the people of Ogun State on the victory.
Abiodun’s victory as declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission was upheld by the tribunal on Saturday.
Delivering the 11-hour judgment, the Chairman of the Tribunal, Hamidu Kunaza, said the petitioner, the Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate in the election, Ladipupo Adebutu, and his party failed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. 
Adebutu had asked the tribunal to quash Abiodun’s victory for not complying with the Electoral Act of 2022, corrupt practices and for not being qualified to have contested the 2023 governorship election in the state.

politics,US court order on Tinubu's CSU academic records a national disgrace - ex-minister,"A former Minister of Aviation, Chief Osita Chidoka, has said a United States Court order directing the Chicago State University to release the academic records of President Bola Tinubu to the presiden...",1st October 2023,https://punchng.com/us-court-order-on-tinubus-csu-academic-records-a-national-disgrace-ex-minister/,Edward Nnachi,"A former Minister of Aviation, Chief Osita Chidoka, has said a United States Court order directing the Chicago State University to release the academic records of President Bola Tinubu to the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2023 elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, is a national disgrace.
The former Corps Marshal of the Federal Road Safety Commission further observed that it was worrisome that authorities such as the Department of State Services, National Intelligence Agency, the Independent National Electoral Commission, and the Embassy of Nigeria with its staff in Washington DC could not unravel the circumstances over the academic history of the President, leaving the daunting task for Atiku to do.
He said this in a statement, on Sunday, a copy of which was obtained by our correspondent.
“That all the aforementioned institutions allowed a man to be sworn in without definitive statements about his qualifications is a national tragedy. For 23 years, the issue of President Tinubu has been a recurring decimal in our national equation. Under his reign, a current youth corps member is serving as minister, and people under investigation by the EFCC and made public are sitting in the Federal Executive Council. And they all passed through security screening.” 
A United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois had, on Saturday, ruled in favour Atiku, and ordered that the Chicago State University should release President Tinubu’s academic record to the former vice president by Monday, October 2.
According to him, the leadership and relevant institutions of this country should bow their heads in shame, if eventually it was discovered the occupier of the nation’s number one office forged his certificates, stressing that the development was both a national and international embarrassment.
He said, “I speak as a Nigerian. That it took the courageous activism of HE. Abubakar Atiku to force the discovery of information concerning the President of Nigeria is a disgrace to our national institutions.      
“As a nation, we have a full retinue of staff at the Department of the State Services, the National Intelligence Agency, the Independent National Electoral Commission, the Embassy of Nigeria with the full complement of staff in Washington DC and the Nigerian judiciary that have variously ruled on matters concerning President Tinubu’s academic qualifications. Yet, we can not have a definitive conclusion about whether he has the academic qualifications he claimed he had or not. Disgraceful.
“The office of the President of Nigeria is so important both in its moral authority and its strategic importance to our national security and safety that nobody who has possible blind spots that can make him or her a potential asset for foreign intelligence or governments should be allowed a mile near that office. This should be a primary burden on all our national institutions. Legal technicalities and silence by state institutions should be deemed high treason.
“It highlights my previous statement that a constitution amendment to finish all electoral cases before the assumption of office is now a matter of urgent national priority. The current disgraceful proceedings against a Nigerian President in a foreign court under election petition matters are damaging to our collective moral and legal standing as a people.
“If it turns out tomorrow that our President presented a forged certificate to INEC, Nigerians will bow down their heads globally in shame. On the other hand, if it turns out that his certificate is genuine, again our reputation as a people is still in tatters because of the failure of national institutions to perform due diligence no matter who is involved. On both counts, it reinforces global perceptions and prejudice against Nigerians. We all bear the burden.  Related News   CSU certificate: Group urges NASS to probe Tinubu  Chicago varsity vindicates Tinubu, Presidency insists, Atiku files documents today  US issues first-ever fine for leaving junk in space   
“A forged certificate finding leaves President Tinubu in a vulnerable position morally and legally. As he did not present primary and secondary certificates to INEC, a forged CSU certificate makes him unqualified to stand for the office of President as he does not possess the minimum qualification S.131(D) of the 1999 Constitution as amended. Of course, the next issue is the case of perjury, the presentation of false documents under oath.
“How INEC accepted a university degree without the qualifying certificates would continue to be a national mystery. A language in our electoral legislation to forestall such obvious infractions is required.
“The decision of the District Court and the whole proceedings is not a moment of triumphalism but a sober moment of introspection. It is a moment when as a nation we ask ourselves.”        
It added, “What are our national values?
Who or which institution should have ordered the full investigation of the questionable certificate?
“Considering that he did not present a primary or secondary certificate, should our courts be concerned with the technicality of the tendering process of the CSU certificate or the disgrace and global moral damage a forged certificate would have wrought on Nigeria?
The former minister queried why did the nation’s security system could not conduct a discrete investigation and advise the candidate and INEC about the status of his certificate.
“A few years ago, the DSS, in an act of institutional independence and courage, wrote to the Senate to reject Police Commissioner Ibrahim Magu as the EFCC chairman not minding his nomination by a sitting President. This was based on their intelligence report of his nefarious conduct that pales into insignificance against a possible forgery case by a President. Why the silence now?
“For me, the issue is beyond legalism. If and that is a big if, the certificate is forged, President Tinubu should resign immediately. It is not a legal matter but a national honour and moral issue. If he does not, the National Assembly should do the needful to restore our dignity as a people. I also expect the Supreme Court to rise to the occasion and restore order to our electoral process.”
Chidoka said, “If the certificate is not forged, the President should conduct a wide-ranging reorganisation of our national security system for failure to save the country from this needless embarrassment and reputational damage.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/06170527/Osita-Chidoka.jpg

The governor, according to a statement made available to newsmen by media aide, Abubakar Bawa, noted that the striking out of all the six grounds presented to the tribunal by the Peoples Democratic Party in the state was clear evidence that they had no genuine case.
According to the statement, “the tribunal’s judgement is a clear testimony of the fact that the nation’s judiciary remains unbiased, describing the judgement as a welcome development to people of the state and all lovers of democracy within and outside Nigeria.
He also commended the tribunal for doing the right thing and being fair after hearing from all those involved in the petition challenging the legitimacy of his victory at the 2023 governorship election. 
Meanwhile, the governor called on the opposition in the state to join hands with his administration to move the state forward, saying that patriotism should now be the driving factor to bolster the socio-economic development of the state.
He further reminded the opposition that 2027 is not far hence the need for them to ginger up for the next battle as the 2023 election is done and dusted.

Days of celebratory events, cultural dance and fireworks followed the announcement of Nigeria’s independence from British colonial rule on Saturday, October 1, 1960. At home and abroad, the spirit was the same.
Regardless of tribe, religion and political leaning, citizens of the most promising black race trooped out en masse to celebrate the opportunity to witness the historic event or be part of its making.
But Nigeria was not alone. It was around the middle of the 20th century, amidst the great wave of independence sweeping across Africa. For activists at the time, the continent could now breathe in peace as the cloak of colonialism was gradually rolled away. 
For Nigerians, independence brought hope in the possibility of a future where the country could do better across all development indices; hope that its challenges would gradually give way to massive development. Many hoped the infrastructure deficit and other challenges that pervaded the previous years would finally be addressed.
However, not many people foresaw the negative possibilities on the other side of self-governance.
Only six years later, the euphoria soon gave way to bloodshed that plunged not just Nigeria but the continent into the dark age of forceful takeover of power. The relics of those dark years still linger in the form of misgovernance, bad leadership, unemployment, infrastructural decay, insecurity and a poor perception in Africa and beyond.      
Although successive leadership promised to roll the dark realities away, or at least reduce them, some of the problems have not gone away, decades after. Worse, they now form the collective identity of Nigeria—stunting her growth and the quality of life for many of her citizens.
As the green and white flags flap on October 1 every year in celebration of freedom and sovereignty, they also flap in the face of unresolved challenges. Though not new, the challenges have evolved with the times and many young Nigerians today find themselves caught in a mess they did not start.
According to many Nigerians who spoke with Sunday PUNCH, the problems facing the country, rather than dissipate, have continued to mutate at an alarming rate, from the time of Tafawa Balewa, who was the first Prime Minister between 1960 and 1966, to incumbent President Bola Tinubu.
Nigeria’s first President was Nnamdi Azikiwe from 1963 to 1966; after which Major General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi ruled from January 1966 to July 1966. After him was General Yakubu Gowon, from 1966 to 1975; while Gen Murtala Mohammed ruled from 1975 to 1976.
After his assassination in February 1976, General Olusegun Obasanjo became the Head of State from 1976 to 1979, and he later handed over power to the democratically elected President Shehu Shagari, who governed from 1979 to 1983, before Major General Muhammadu Buhari overthrew his government and ruled from 1983 to 1985.
General Ibrahim Babangida ousted Buhari and ruled from 1985 to 1993; after which he installed Ernest Shonekan as the Head of Interim National Government which lasted from August to November, 1993 when General Sani Abacha sacked his government and took over power.
The late Abacha ruled from 1993 to 1998, and after his death on June 8, 1998, General Abdulsalami Abubakar became the Head of State. He later handed over power to democratically elected President, Olusegun Obasanjo in May, 1999. Obasanjo was the President till 2007; he was succeeded by Umaru Yar’Adua, who died in office in May, 2010; and his deputy, Goodluck Jonathan, became the President and was in office till 2015. President Muhammadu Buhari took over power from him, and after his second term terminated in May 2023, Tinubu was sworn in as the President.        
Despite the number of persons that have led the country, however, many Nigerians say the same old problems persist, and now in newer forms.
For example, the stable electric power supply that eluded Nigeria decades ago has continued to hurt young and old Nigerians. The noise of generators may have staved off total darkness, but the unstable power supply has worsened over the years.
Also, the youth, full of energy and potential, battle unemployment or under-employment. Security challenges remain real and deadly while disunity festers even as calls for good governance grow louder day by day.
Poor power supply
Nigeria’s power problem is old and deep. With a gnawing infrastructure deficit, power shortage, prolonged blackouts and heavy debts, the power sector has defeated every administration since 1999 and is dealing its perennial blows to the Tinubu administration through periodic grid collapse. After collapsing 98 times under his predecessor, the new President had his first taste on September 14.
Not known to discriminate, the power challenge has affected even those who should be immune to its sting. On January 23, 2023, the presidential campaign rally of the All Progressives Congress in Bauchi State was brought to an abrupt end by power outage.
The rally was taking place at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Stadium, Bauchi when the power cut and the sound system went off and could not be restored. Eventually, the then President Muhammadu Buhari and his successor, Bola Tinubu, could not address the mammoth crowd.      
Since 1960, Nigeria has not generated up to 6000MW of electricity, the Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors confirmed. The Executive Director of Research and Advocacy of ANED, an umbrella body of power distribution companies, Mr Sunday Oduntan, decried the unstable power supply nationwide, saying Nigeria requires 200,000MW of power to meet the electricity needs of its 200+ million citizens since the international standards is 1,000MW to one million people.
Although the total installed generating capacity through the regular plants and the National Integrated Power Project plants was about 11,165.4MW in 2015, the transmission grid, though boasting an installed capacity of 7,000MW and Network Operational Capacity of 5,500MW, could barely evacuate and send 4,000MW to the DisCos.
Daily average transmission averaged 3,500MW and the 4,517MW transmission recorded was a one-hit wonder because a serial system collapse followed. While USAID estimates the total installed capacity at 12,522MW, Energypedia says only about 11,165MW is grid-connected, and the actual available capacity is just 7,139.6MW. However, the Transmission Company of Nigeria can hardly distribute 5,000MW as of the time of filing this report. When it reaches or surpasses this, the system reacts by collapsing.
The consequence is depicted by the World Bank, which revealed that the average Nigerian experienced approximately 4,600 hours of power outage annually – that is, darkness for over half a year. The generators that fill this power gap often unleash a cascade of challenges: noise pollution, which contributes significantly to climate change through the release of CO2, health hazards, and increased business cost.
In the industrial sector, the narrative is even grimmer. According to the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, about 40 per cent of operational costs are attributed to alternative power generation.
This economic haemorrhage transcends fiscal boundaries, eroding competitiveness for businesses and stifling innovation. Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises, the backbone of the Nigerian economy, are not spared either. In a survey, over 60 per cent cited poor power supply as a significant obstacle to economic productivity.
Meanwhile, successive administrations have embarked on ambitious journeys, but they have failed to address the problem.  
Billions of dollars have been sunk into power sector reforms, in addition to the 2013 privatisation, but the narrative remains unchanged, while the agitation for a permanent solution to the problem persists.
Obsolete infrastructure, vandalism and a convoluted mix of administrative and regulatory bottlenecks accentuate the crisis. Despite the country’s abundant natural gas reserves, power plants grapple with gas shortages due to infrastructural deficits and security challenges. Also, in spite of the dams across the country, hydropower has yet to be fully maximised, with some dams and the equipment purchased abandoned since the 1980s.
While many people in Lagos and some other major cities could boast of hours of electricity daily, many people in rural communities say the situation has only become worse. In fact, bothered by how the power problem has persistently defied solutions, a former Minister of Power once said witches and wizards were behind the power problem. While the outage is worrisome, tens of millions of Nigerians do not even have access to electricity.
The immediate past Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said in 2022 that 62 per cent of Nigerians lacked access to electricity.
While successive governments promised a total transformation of the sector, Nigerians still groan in darkness. Many electricity users told Sunday PUNCH that it was shameful that 63 years after, the power problem remains bad, even as they call for concerted efforts to address the problem.
Naira’s free fall in troubled economy
In recent years, many Nigerians and economic experts have expressed concerns over the state of the economy; from the huge debts to rising inflation rate, low revenue, unemployment and high exchange rate, all of which have compounded Nigerians’ woes.      
For example, the naira has maintained its free fall, with the parallel market hitting N1000/$ recently while the Investors & Exporters’ window also remains unstable.
However, the naira recovered on Friday, September 22, 2023, after President Bola Tinubu nominated Olayemi Cardoso as the acting head of CBN. Cardoso’s nomination moved the naira upwards by N10 against the dollar in the black market, closing at N990/$1.
According to experts, the exchange rate depicts an embattled currency, slipping from N450/$ in January to N1000/$ in the parallel market, which has resulted in increased cost of goods, escalating living costs and a populace grappling with the icy grip of inflation.
In August 2023, the National Bureau of Statistics reported an inflation rate hovering around 24.08 per cent, with the common man feeling the pinch at marketplaces and stores.
The implications stretch beyond the immediacy of elevated prices to the long-term prospects of investment and economic growth.
External debt has surged by N13.38tn ($17.38bn) in the second quarter of 2023. The Debt Management Office said Nigeria’s external debt rose to N33.25tn ($43.16bn) in Q2 2023 from N19.64tn ($42.67bn) in the preceding quarter, an increase credited mainly to the weak naira rather than fresh borrowing.
Many economists have however expressed concern over the state of the economy.        
High unemployment
63 years after, Nigeria still grapples with ballooning youth unemployment crisis, which has not only worsened crime but also contributed immensely to brain drain that is now at an alarming rate.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics put youth underemployment at 6.9 per cent and youth unemployment at 18.1 per cent, figures that have since been faulted by experts who argue a much higher rate.
While the debate is on, it seems clear to all that millions of young individuals have been relegated to the fringes of economic participation—their aspirations stifled, their innovation untapped and their contributions muted.
In a country with about 70 per cent of its citizens under 25, the unemployment crisis has been described as a time bomb and national emergency.
Early 2023, the World Bank lent weight to this narrative, warning that the unemployment abyss could continue its ominous expansion unless drastic measures are undertaken.  Related News   Eight Jos residents killed in Independence Day attack  Tinubu’s Independence Day broadcast: Between will and shall  Mixed reactions greet Tinubu’s daughter over independence day message   
According to some experts, at the core of the escalating crisis is a complex interplay of factors, including an education system not fully aligned with market demands, a private sector stifled by economic volatility, and public sector job creation efforts that are dwarfed by the magnitude of other challenges.      
In the streets of Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, young graduates, teeming with skills and aspirations, encounter the harsh reality of limited job openings. In the Northeast, where insurgency has ravaged communities, students risk their lives to gain education.
A nation under siege
About a week ago, the President fumed over the abduction of 30 students of the Federal University, Gusau in Zamfara State by bandits in the early hours of Friday. As of Sunday, 21 students were still in captivity; seven had been rescued while two escaped.
The police revealed that “On September 22, 2023, at about 02:50hrs, suspected bandits, riding on about 50 motorcycles, armed with sophisticated weapons invaded three students’ rented apartments in Sabon Gida Village near the Federal University Gusau and kidnapped an unspecified number of students, taking them to an unknown destination.”
The President, in a statement on Sunday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Ajuri Ngelale, directed security agencies to rescue the abducted students. “There is no moral justification for such heinous crimes against innocent victims whose only ‘offence’ was their pursuit of quality education,” Tinubu said.
The President was right. It is his turn to bear the brunt of the terrorism ravaging the country for over a decade. The kidnap was a clear message from the bandits that variants of insecurity, which his predecessors since independence could not totally resolve, remained alive.
According to the Global Terrorism Index (2023), Nigeria ranks eighth in the top 10 countries with the highest terrorism prevalence. Boko Haram, a terrorist group, and banditry across the northern states have become frightening household names. Over a decade of insurgency has claimed over 30,000 lives and displaced about 2.5 million people, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported.      
Also, the farmer-herder clashes in the Middle Belt and parts of the North and indeed other parts of the country continue to widen the scale of armed conflict, threatening food security on an unprecedented scale. Caught in the security challenges are students being kidnapped and murdered. In addition, many women, children and men have been killed, some in kidnappers’ dens and some missing.
From 2013 to 2023, no fewer than 78,148 Nigerians were killed nationwide. In its 2023 Security report, Beacon Consulting, a security risk management and intelligence consulting company, revealed that 16,644 Nigerians were killed by terrorists, 8,475 Nigerians by banditry, 1,897 by farmers-herders clashes, and 1,410 by social upheaval.
While the North-East bears the significant burden of Boko Haram, with Borno State being the epicenter, different parts of the country have different tales of woe to share. From kidnapping for ransom to banditry and communal clashes, the country is still not immune to insecurity, years after.
Poor Governance and Corruption
Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index consistently paints a damning picture for Nigeria. With a score of 24 out of 100 in the 2022 index, the country ranks 150 out of 180 nations globally. These figures underscore a reality where corruption is not the exception but, tragically, an entrenched aspect of the administrative fabric in the country.
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission estimates that approximately $20bn is lost annually due to corruption, which manifests boldly in underfunded hospitals, dilapidated schools, bad roads, decrepit infrastructure and huge debts. This has over the years worsened the trust deficit between the government and the governed.
While the country celebrates uninterrupted 24 years of democracy, the electoral process has continued to throw up issues of concern. According to the National Democratic Institute, allegations of vote-buying, electoral violence and ballot stuffing have characterised multiple election cycles.      
As the country marks another independence anniversary, about seven months after the general elections, the outcome of the elections is still being contested in court. According to some observers, this does not only undermine the integrity of the electoral process, it also undermines the credibility of constituted governments.
Interactions with many Nigerians indicated the level of dissatisfaction many Nigerians have about governance in the country, as many people insisted that good governance remained elusive.
Nigerians harassed abroad
Although the country prides itself as the giant of Africa, the way Nigerians are treated in some countries seems to be in contrast with that reputation. Many Nigerian international travellers have lamented the incidences of heightened suspicion, discrimination and derogatory comments abroad. Not even the Vienna Conventions governing diplomatic and consular relations between states could have averted such experiences.
In May, 2016, the then British Prime Minister, David Cameron, referred to Nigeria as a fantastically corrupt country during a conversation with the late Queen Elizabeth during an event at the Buckingham Palace to mark the Queen’s 90th birthday. The Queen died on September 8, 2022.
Cameron had said, “We’ve got some leaders of some fantastically corrupt countries coming to Britain… Nigeria and Afghanistan are possibly the two most corrupt countries in the world.” This arguably speaks to the way Nigerians are perceived abroad.
Meanwhile, in August 2021, for instance, a Nigerian diplomat was assaulted in Indonesia. In a viral video clip, the diplomat was seen being manhandled by immigration officers in Jakarta.      
The incident illuminated a grim reality of the degradation Nigerians often face abroad.
Further amplifying this narrative was a similar incident in DR Congo where a diplomatic passport holder, protected by the Vienna Convention, was met with a torrent of physical assault.
Reports also confirmed the burgling of the Nigerian Embassy in Kinshasa by a diplomatic police officer deployed in the mission and the illegal seizure of Nigerian diplomatic property in the choice area of Gombe.
In Accra, the authorities demolished some properties belonging to the High Commission, which was a violation of Nigeria’s sovereignty.
According to some analysts, this and other disturbing incidents are not isolated but weave into a broader tapestry of humiliations that Nigerians, both citizens and officials, experience globally.
Thus, 63 years after independence, Nigeria battles for respect and dignity on the global stage.
The Indonesian and Congolese incidents stirred diplomatic waters, prompting immediate response from the Nigerian government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Indonesian Ambassador, demanding full accountability, while assurances of the safety and dignity of Nigerians were sought from DR Congo. Yet, many Nigerians believe that these showed the extent of disrespect for Nigeria.      
Citizens must work to restore lost glory — Amedu-Ode
For Nigeria’s former Ambassador to Singapore, Dr Ogbole Amedu-Ode, the results from the 63-year journey are far from satisfactory.
Citing retrogression through the years, he said Nigerians must exert themselves to “rebuild and restore” the country to “lost glory.”
He stated, “It is imperative that we look inwards to do some housekeeping. In the 1960s and 1970s, what was the status of Nigeria among nations? How many Nigerians were voting with their feet and heading in that direction? What was the level, if any, of peddling in psychotropic substances?
“Today, because the national economy has been in a tailspin since the Ibrahim Babangida era and progressively so, more and more of our compatriots have deemed it fit to search for greener pastures outside the shores of Nigeria. A significant number of these are roughnecks who indulge in less than noble enterprises, including trafficking in hard drugs.
“In the long term, we must exert ourselves to rebuild and restore Nigeria to its lost glory – the era of the 1960s, 1970s and the early 1980s. With a robust politico-economic circumstance within our national space and knowing that foreign policy is a projection of domestic happenings, Nigeria will be better regarded among nations.”
Leaders failed to harness human resources — Onunaiju      
Also citing the instances of poor treatment meted to Nigerians abroad, the Research Director, Center for China Studies, Abuja, Charles Onunaiju, lamented that in the past 63 years “our leaders have not harnessed the vast human resources available to us”.
“If we want to earn respect from outside, we must begin from home. If we want the world to take us seriously, we must get our acts together,” he told Sunday PUNCH.
Nigeria must fight corruption to succeed — Adeniran
The Executive Chairman, Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership, Debo Adeniran, also told Sunday PUNCH that although Nigeria had grown to earn the respect of the global community due to its contribution in arts and entertainment, it had yet to stabilise its democracy in a way that benefits its citizens.
He added, “We should see ourselves as being lucky to sustain the present democracy for the past 24 years unbroken. And despite all odds, the civil war and the rest of the insecurity, we still have Nigeria as one entity.
“We have made progress in some areas, mainly because the products of Nigeria have been very marketable internationally, including our intellectuals. Several of them occupy positions of power in the United States, the United Kingdom and other powerful countries.
“Nigerians are cherished for their music, literature, arts and science. Be that as it may, we have been unable to stabilise our democracy in such a way that will benefit everybody. We are trying to find our feet on the pedestal of democracy.”      
He argued that although the country had made efforts to fight widespread corruption, it must cover more grounds if Nigerians would see meaningful progress.
Adeniran added, “If steady progress is made in controlling all the defects we have identified in our socio-political and economic areas, then it will not be too long before we get things right.
“As long as the system begins to apply its laws, punishing those sabotaging our economy, those who make it difficult to live in Nigeria, we will reduce the penchant to cut corners by successive governments.
“Then there will be infrastructure, good education, good healthcare delivery. So, we just need a little more push.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/01005849/NIGERIAN-PAST-LEADERS.jpg
politics,"Regional govt best for Nigeria, states spreading poverty – Wande Abimbola","A former Vice Chancellor of the Obafemi Awolowo University and popular professor of African Languages and Literature, Wande Abimbola, speaks to TUNDE AJAJA on Nigeria’s 63rd independence anniversary...",1st October 2023,https://punchng.com/regional-govt-best-for-nigeria-states-spreading-poverty-wande-abimbola/,Tunde Ajaja,"A former Vice Chancellor of the Obafemi Awolowo University and popular professor of African Languages and Literature, Wande Abimbola, speaks to TUNDE AJAJA on Nigeria’s 63rd independence anniversary and the way out of the country’s many challenges
Nigeria is celebrating its 63rd Independence anniversary today, as a historian, how will you assess the country’s journey so far?
I think we have fared fairly well. Democracy is thriving, and in spite of all the troubles we have had, Nigeria is still a good place to live in. Being the biggest economy in Africa is an achievement by itself. But the long period of military rule set us back somewhat. I think the greatest blemish of military rule was when late Major Gen Aguiyi Ironsi scrapped the regional system (Northern, Western and Eastern) under which we gained our independence. If the regional system was still in place, Nigeria would have had greater development. Then the second factor was the oil boom, which became oil doom. We didn’t know how to handle that kind of sudden wealth and we still don’t know how to handle it till now. But I think by and large, we have made wonderful strides, especially in the field of education.
Could you expatiate on that? 
We now have excess of 100 universities and some of them are well known around the world, like the University of Ibadan, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, University of Lagos, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and even some of the newer private universities. However, I always say that there are certain ingredients of nation building which we have neglected. How can we claim to be a nation, an independent nation, when none of the major languages of Nigeria is employed in the process of education from primary to university level? How can we claim that we are independent when we don’t speak our own languages? In the legislative houses, I think except in Lagos State, where they speak Yoruba language part of the time. Others speak English. If we want to lay claim to genuine independence, the three or nine main languages in Nigeria should be used in the training of our children from primary school to the university level. I don’t know why that is not so obvious to our leaders. Is it not a shame that at the Senate and House of Representatives or even at the local government or state parliaments we speak English. That is an urgent matter that we should look into.
Do you think reversion to regional system of government remains the way out?
To return Nigeria to the three or four regional system is an urgent matter and if you want to amend it a little bit, we can recognise all the six geopolitical zones. Don’t forget that we started with three regions but later on they added Mid-Western region, making four. President Goodluck Jonathan tried to do that with that 2014 conference but unfortunately, he didn’t complete it. If he did, he would have won a second term. I strongly urge President Bola Tinubu to look into this matter; call for the conclusions and recommendations of the conference that Jonathan put in place, examine it and as quickly as possible adopt the six regions. Once that is in place, we should then begin to put in place a committee in each of the six regions to look into how our indigenous languages, say in the next three or four years, would be employed in the educational system from primary to university level.      
That implies that you are proposing that the 36 states should be scrapped?
The 36-state structure is neither manageable nor sustainable. Nigeria is the same size as the state of Texas in the United States and a little state to the North-East of Texas, known as Oklahoma; it’s the same land mass. Just imagine such an area being divided into 36 states. However, the other area I want to highlight is that we should cease to be just a producer of raw materials. A Chinese adage says the happiness of a nation is like a tree; farming is its roots, while manufacturing and commerce are its leaves and branches. If the root is harmed, the branches break down, the leaves fall and the tree dies. We should pay great attention to agriculture, manufacturing and commerce. These are the failings of successive governments of Nigeria since independence to date.
When you said the military caused the country a setback by scrapping the regional system of government, conversely there have been arguments that the military regime wasn’t totally bad because a number of the lasting infrastructure in the country were built by the military and that rights abuse synonymous with military rule had been perpetuated by democratically elected leaders. What do you make of that argument?
It is not an argument, because of bridges and roads? When we are talking of development, we are not talking about bridges and roads alone. We should be a manufacturing country, we should promote agriculture and tourism. There are nations that live mainly on tourism. Some regimes were better than others, but we wanted a democratic state that is self-sustaining and has peace. However, you are right that the so-called democratic governments we have had have not done much better. And why is that? The reason is that you cannot sustain a 36-state structure. All the money that we are realising from oil is used to pay salaries and overheads for thousands of officials. Nigeria is like a father with 36 children and fixed income, compared with a father with three or four or even six children with the same income. There is no way the family with 36 children will not go hungry. We don’t need 36 states. In the history of humankind, there is no place this small that has divided itself into 36 governments, in addition to the Federal Capital Territory and the Federal Government. It’s a shame. That is the source of Nigeria’s poverty and misery.
Given the perennial suspicion between the North and the South, there are people who have argued that the amalgamation of 1914 by Lord Lugard has not helped and that the country would have been better if the northern and southern protectorates were not merged. What do you think?
That is true; I agree, but I will go further to say the regional structure was the perfect fit and we should have adhered to it. Granted that what Lugard did was wrong, when we became independent, if the late Gen Ironsi had not cancelled the three regional structure, Nigeria would have been in a different place today. That was the sin of the military government. Since then, not one inch has been added to Nigeria but we started dividing it into pieces; we had 12, then 19, then 21, then 36 states, and some people are even asking for their state. That was our doom and it’s what we need to look into. Instead of asking for more states, let us look into how we can have stable electricity, pipe borne water, exploit the minerals under the ground, which Eledumare (the Almighty) has endowed us with but is being stolen by people from outside every day. We also have to be wary of the gospel of prosperity preached in some religious houses, be it Muslims, Christians or you follow indigenous worship. Everybody is looking for money and people want to have multiple vehicles and houses everywhere. Another thing we have lost is our values, we now have strange values. We have departed from the values of our ancestors; of dignity, integrity and hard work. What we have now is how can I get money by any means? Our values have been very badly distorted, largely by the two world religions, the fever of which has gripped Nigeria and the African continent. I am not against any religion; it’s a matter of choice, but should we throw away our autochthonous values and now embrace the gospel of prosperity, which will lead to an endless chase?
But people seem to be chasing wealth regardless of their religion.        
If you are a Christian or Muslim or whatever you espouse, there is a lot we can all embrace from our indigenous value system, which has been there since time immemorial. We were born into those values, such as tolerance and making peace among ourselves. We should not respond to the yearnings of these two major religions to eradicate our indigenous value system. If that happens, we would have been so distorted that we will not recover from it for the next two or three centuries. For example, look at some Christian missions saying that our ancestors are evil and they should be exorcised. Anybody who exorcises his ancestors and their values at best becomes a slave. Our ancestors are not bad people. Most of them are like saints, and we should worship them. We should embrace them, even if we are Christians of Muslims. Why are the Muslims embracing the ancestors of Islam? Why are the Christians doing the same thing?
What do you make of the new push for Isese and the resistance in some places, like the drama in Kwara State?
What happened there was slavery. Are we returning to slavery? Nigeria is a secular state, why should any authority prevent anybody from espousing what they believe in? Anybody who is doing that wants to enslave you, whereas slavery ended a long time ago, so also did colonialism. We should allow the three main religions of Nigeria to thrive. Nobody should lord it over another person if you want peace and progress, and there cannot be progress in the absence of peace. If we want progress, we should have justice and we would have peace. Anybody who arrested that young man in Ilorin, Kwara State, is our enemy and should be dealt with severely. What has he done to upset anything; because he was talking about his belief? He shouldn’t go to prison or be locked up because of that. We have to live in a society where there is free speech.
Many people practice Christianity, Islam and indigenous religion, yet Nigeria is bedeviled by many problems, why hasn’t this translated to a more conscientious citizenry?
It’s because of the erasure of our indigenous value system; like love for one another, peace, being contented with what you have and dignity. We have replaced all of those with gospel of prosperity. Like I said, I’m bothered about intolerance in Nigeria. We should be tolerant of one another. In the Yoruba pantheon of divinities, they are in excess of 400 plus one. I have never encountered a Babalawo who worships Ifa saying anybody who worships Oya should leave the town or anybody who worships Osun will not enter the kingdom of heaven. All these came with the two world religions. They should be put in check. We cannot allow that in any civilised society where you say that a certain belief system that some people have adhered to and have governed their lives with should be eradicated. Fortunately, in the constitution, Nigeria is a secular state. You can practice your religion without any hindrance. Don’t go out of your way to say anybody who is a Christian is going to hell. We should put laws in place to regulate all those preaching intolerance so that there can be peace in our society.
In recent times, some persons have been killed for what was termed blasphemy and the government has been unable to prosecute the culprits, how do you feel about that?
That’s what I’m talking about; that there should be justice and tolerance. We should aspire to live in a society where there is justice and tolerance for the beliefs of others as long as those beliefs and practices don’t offend the law.      
You once said that Nigerians encourage politicians to steal, should politicians not take the blame for failing to live by example?  Related News   Only regional govt’ll save Nigeria  from break-up –Orire, Ekiti APC chieftain  Let’s revert to regional governments — Effiong-Bassey  Ohanaeze, Niger Delta leaders back Yoruba’s demand for regional govt   
The politicians are part of our society. It’s like you have a big pot of dirty water, from which you can draw 40 to 50 or more cups of water. It doesn’t matter if I have a big cup or a small cup, the water that would be taken out of it will be filthy. So, it’s the Nigerian society that is filthy. People need to examine themselves and change their ways. The politicians and the corrupt people are only part of that same filth. It’s because the society is corrupt that the politicians are corrupt. We have to curb this insatiable desire for wealth and material things. That’s why I keep stressing that what we see now was not the life of our ancestors. If they put you in charge of a place, don’t steal the money that belongs to others. Preaching doesn’t really, by itself, make that much of a change, but if we can put some of our indigenous practices in place, it may help. In the absence of that, we can put in place draconian laws.
What kind of indigenous practices do you have in mind for checkmating bad behaviour?
When I was being sworn in as an adviser to former President Olusegun Obasanjo, I came from the United States that morning, and I didn’t know he had assembled many people, including journalists, in the hall. All the ministers and advisers had been sworn in about a month earlier. So, Obasanjo asked me; this is the Bible and Quran, you can swear. I told him I’m not a Christian or Muslim. He said so what are you going to swear with? He asked if I had thunder stone of Sango in my pocket and that I could use that. I said even if I had a thunderstone in my pocket, if I took out a stone, people might think I wanted to stone them and they would run away. He said if he had known he would have asked me to get an iron object so I could swear with. That is what we swear with, but in the absence of that, I said I would swear with my Iroke (the staff that a Babalawo holds in his hand to accentuate prayer and song). That was what I used and the news was everywhere. If across the ethnic groups people swear with the symbols of their ancestors, things would have been better. In Benin Republic, the government is modernising and reconstructing innumerable shrines. In 2000, they gave official recognition to voodoo and they are now refurbishing all the voodoo houses of worship throughout the country. In Ghana, they are constructing a huge museum where you can go to look at all the images of their ancestors and gods throughout their history. Now, Ghana will become a tourist destination, the same thing for Benin Republic. If we have tolerance, some of our indigenous things, artifacts, images of our ancestors and so on will become a money-making venture that people will come from all over the world to see.
You were at the Senate in the Third Republic at the same time with Tinubu, did you work together or you were just colleagues?
He was the chairman of a committee; I think it was a committee in charge of finance or something like that. He’s a highly cultured gentleman. I don’t know much about anything else that he may be or not be, and he is a politician par excellence. He knows how to make things happen as far as politics is concerned. I have met him only once since we left the Senate. He was one of the people who installed me as leader of the Senate, and the Senate that I led, we were paid only N5,000 a month. The one way fare by air from Abuja to Lagos was N2,500. When you are coming back, it’s another N2,500. That was where the money went. Every senator was to visit their senatorial district at least once a month. There were no allowances but we were catered for at Hilton Hotel. It is immoral, to say the least, that anybody should be earning millions when his fellow men and women have nothing to eat. They need to re-examine it. People are wondering why the Federal Government or the President cannot do anything about it, but the lawmakers fix their own allowances. They need to do something about it themselves and they should stop this practice of awarding money to senators to be able to award contracts for roads and the likes (constituency project). It’s a hidden way of finding more money to steal. I don’t think Tinubu himself can do anything about it, but there could be a way that it could be addressed.
Do you think Nigeria needs bicameral legislature?  
We don’t. I don’t know who saddled us with the presidential system. It is too costly. We cannot afford it. We should go back to the system bequeathed to us by the British. Lawmakers should earn allowances instead of salaries. They should live in their homes and whenever there is a meeting, they go there and after the meeting, everybody should go.
Are you implying a part-time legislature?
Yes, part-time legislature. If that is not going to work, for whatever reason, reduce their salaries to the barest minimum. Nigeria is not a rich country, all of us know that. I don’t know why the people taking these salaries are not ashamed of themselves. It’s wrong. Part of the money they make are used to bribe voters. Why should election involve bribery? If you don’t want to vote for me, fine. What’s the need for bribery? If you are not up to it, that is when you bribe people. And if there is no honour in an office, what is the value holding that office? We have to find a way to reduce the monthly salaries of our federal lawmakers and governors who have become emperors. We have forgotten that we are poor as a country. We are rich in natural resources but even with that, we are not rich. I give you an example; when I came to the United States after the late Gen Sani Abacha’s coup ousted us from the Senate. I was a professor at Harvard University. That year, Harvard University had a budget of $12.5bn. That was one university. The city of Boston had a budget of $20bn and Nigeria’s budget for that year was N12bn. If we were like a small country like Kuwait or United Arab Emirate and so on, the money we are earning from oil will make all of us rich, but when you divide the money we are earning from oil per head, we are still poor. And we should not depend on oil alone. We should return to agriculture. I always say that the moment our young people left the farms and didn’t return was the end of our civilisation. There should be sufficient peace and tranquility for young people return to the farm, whether for poultry or growing arable crops and for them to live peacefully with their family. That was what we did for centuries.
Since you and the President were colleagues, would you consider leveraging your relationship as former colleagues to make recommendations to him on the reversion to regional government or you are no longer in touch?
I said earlier that I met him only once since we left the Senate. I don’t go after people, and I’m an old man. Even though I’m not tired, I don’t run after people. I don’t take money from anybody and I don’t cherish the way of life that most of my countrymen cherish. I don’t have a house in Abuja, Lagos or Ibadan. I don’t care about all those things. Anybody who needs my advice; if I cannot go there, I will talk to them on phone or on video.
Apart from reverting to regional government, do you think there is any other legacy the President can leave behind?
Yes, a safe society. It is the duty of government to guarantee our safety. You cannot even travel from Lagos to Ibadan without the fear for your life. The South-West is even like a paradise compared with the North and the East in terms of security. President Tinubu should find a way to eradicate these marauders. In those days, I was a lecturer at the University of Lagos in the late 1960s to 1972, every month I would go home to visit my parents and I would travel at night because that was the best time to travel. The place where I lived more than anywhere else was on Bode Thomas Street in Surulere. From Bode Thomas to my father’s house in Oyo was two hours. Sometimes, I could do it in even one hour, 45 minutes. Granted, there were not too many cars at that time but there was peace. I never encountered anybody on the road, shooting or disturbing the peace. That should be the number one objective of Mr Tinubu so that we can all live in peace. Where I live in the US, people visit me from other states and once it’s getting late I remind them, and they would say it’s not a problem, because it’s rare to find such attacks there. We should be able to travel to every nook and cranny of Nigeria during the day and night without being afraid of some deranged individuals.      
As a former vice chancellor, how do you assess the Nigerian education system in the areas of standards, the proposed Student Loan for indigent students, and then the way forward?
You are talking of indigent students, how about indigent professors, lecturers and staff. My last visit to the university where I was vice chancellor at Ile Ife was about two months ago. I was talking to the members of my department; the department that I started, and somebody told me that the best paid professor who has reached the end of the scale for a full professor at that time amounted to like $700 per month. When I clear my garden in the US, the gardener takes $300. If I clear it twice, he would have taken $600. Another thing I want to talk about is that many people are impoverished. In a country where the naira is between N700 to N1,000 to $1, I always say that when the currency of a nation is devalued to that extent, it is not the currency that is devalued, it is the people because you can’t live the way you want to live anymore. What can we do so that our productivity will bring about the revaluation of our naira so it can have the value it deserves? We have seen what Tinubu did in Lagos and he seems to understand a bit of finance. He should put it in place for all of Nigeria. And as long as we don’t return to the farms and become more productive, for so long will our currency have little or no value compared with other currencies in the world. So, productivity is the answer.
What should be done to make the universities better?
We have many universities, maybe close to 200 of them. All the curricula of those universities should be re-examined, so that whether you go there to read mathematics or chemistry or history, if you want to start a trade, they would have taught you the rudiments of how to do that while in the university. We need to revamp the curricular of our universities so that what the graduates can do by and for themselves is included in the curriculum.
If the Federal Government is going to lend money to students, it’s a welcome development and I salute the government for that. But they did that in the US since the time of Clinton and they are still doing it till now. Sometimes, a person graduates and doesn’t easily find work or the work they find is not enough to pay back the loan. Maybe you borrowed $30,000 but now you have to pay back $200,000, so it becomes a burden.
The Federal Government should set up a commission on how graduates of our numerous universities can be self-employed. I also want to add that we should return to those early days when our country solved some of its problems through communal efforts.
The argument people often make is that they could only do little.        
I was born in the village, and for the first couple of years, to go to my school in Oyo town, I had to go through the bush. Early in the morning, around 3 am, I would trek seven miles. But at a point, people rose up and said this wasn’t good and that since vehicles had started arriving, let us make a road to link some of the villages. They linked villages through self-help. Many people of my generation participated in that kind of self-help to build roads and even help people to build and roof their houses. We have to return to that practice. Why should everybody depend on the government when it does not even have all the money? Some of the people suffering basic infrastructure have successful children in different parts of the world, so why don’t they call them to help. Things that were done through such communal efforts or self help hardly fail because people nurture them. When I talk of the indigenous autochthonous values of our ancestors, that’s the kind of thing I’m talking about. I told my colleagues at OAU that we should find a way to do some things ourselves. Some people can contribute their labour and those who have money can contribute, for the benefit of the people. Now, some mega churches have one or two jets, instead of that, why can’t they find a way to sustain the institutions? Some of them have universities; do they have an endowment that will be there forever instead of buying a jet with it for the pastor, or the preacher asking for half a billion if they want the grace of God. Why not use those billions that people contribute to set up an endowment for that university, which will be there forever. I’m not talking about the churches alone; it applies to everybody. We need to return to the ways of our ancestors and help with what we can without waiting for the government for everything. That’s part of what I mean by our autochthonous values.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/30214019/WANDE-ABIMBOLA.jpg

politics,Lawyer faults allegations against Ondo deputy gov,"A legal practitioner, Mr Allen Sowore, has faulted all the allegations levelled against the Ondo State Deputy Governor, Mr Lucky Aiyedatiwa, by the state House of Assembly, describing the allegations ...",30th September 2023,https://punchng.com/lawyer-faults-allegations-against-ondo-deputy-gov/,Peter Dada,"A legal practitioner, Mr Allen Sowore, has faulted all the allegations levelled against the Ondo State Deputy Governor, Mr Lucky Aiyedatiwa, by the state House of Assembly, describing the allegations as frivolous and ridiculous.
It was gathered that the gross misconduct allegation against the embattled deputy governor had been broken down into 14 offences.
Some of the allegations include speaking against the governor’s health, causing division among the state executive members, and misappropriation of funds among others.
The lawyer, in a statement on Saturday, said there was a need for the House to employ fairness and evidence-based approach in dealing with the matter. 
Taking some of the allegations, Sowore said, “Allegation one, press release and interview against the governor, particularly as it pertains to his health. Apart from the fact that section 39 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) guarantees freedom of expression, where exactly did the deputy governor make unfair comments about the governor’s health?
“The governor has sacked all the deputy governor’s media aides for the same offence, yet there’s no evidence. The action of Mr. Governor in this regard is, in effect, an attack on press freedom. The media handlers of Mr. Governor have not disclosed any information about the governor’s health status and whereabouts to avoid misinformation.

“Allegations two and three. These are the most ridiculous allegations against the deputy governor. If I may ask, which of our laws regulates political conduct? What is causing division among the State Executive Members?      
According to him, allegation 10, as it pertains to N500 million for the administration of the local governments was nebulous, vague, and undefined allegation because the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs was directly in charge of the administration of the 18 local government areas in the state.
“What about the chairmen who are directly responsible for their respective LGAs? Who initiated the proposal? Which account was it taken from? Who approved it?”, he said.
He added, “Bribery allegations must be supported by concrete evidence, including information on the source, recipient, and circumstances surrounding the alleged bribe. Was the bribe paid directly into the personal account of the deputy governor? Which of the kings made the payment?”
On allegations 12, 13 and 14, he said, “These allegations concern the management of the funds meant for the State Emergency Management Agency, which I’m sure has an executive officer. If anything goes wrong, you have to arrest and prosecute him first. If the deputy governor is culpable or fails in his supervisory role, his offence would be negligence or an assessor. He’s not the principal suspect.
“This is disheartening at a critical time when men and women of good conscience and patriotism should be asking the pertinent question: Where is Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, the man who was elected to govern the state?” Sowore said.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/14102453/Lucky-Aiyedatiwa.png

In a statement on Saturday, Bamidele congratulated Nigerians across all socio-economic and political strata on the 63rd anniversary since Nigeria became an independent nation.
Bamidele observed that Nigeria, from October 1, 1960 to date, despite her internal challenges, remained “a strong, united and indivisible nation that still provides strong leadership not only for West Africa but also the entire Africa.” 
With the new government at the helm of affairs, Bamidele assured Nigerians at home and in the diaspora that the federation will soon come out of diverse challenges undermining her progress, citing diverse development-driven reforms that the new government has initiated.
The senate leader, therefore, urged Nigerians to team up with the new government to lead the federation out of the doldrums; implement key reforms that will create limitless opportunities for her teeming young population and rebuild global confidence in the country.
He, specifically, appealed to the leadership of the NLC and TUC not to embark on an indefinite strike in the national interest, saying such an action “will further inflict pains on Nigerians at the time the new government is working hard to address their concerns and grievances.

“At a time like this, labour unions are advised to embrace dialogue rather than consider options that will compound the sufferings of the people. At a time like this, all parties are supposed to go into negotiation with absolute trust in the new government.”
He noted that President Bola Tinubu’s economic reforms would soon begin to yield positive outcomes that would exponentially boost the standard of living among Nigerians irrespective of their socio-economic status.
The senate leader hailed the founding fathers of Nigeria “for their unalloyed patriotism, towering nationalism, uncommon sacrifice and dogged struggle that culminated in the independence of the country on October 1, 1960.
“As Nigerians, we are under obligation to ensure that the labour of our heroes will never be in vain. I congratulate Nigerians as our nation turns 63 as a strong, united and indivisible nation that the world over is now waiting for to occupy her rightful place among nations.”
Bamidele enjoined Nigerians to maximise the opportunity inherent in their comradeship, willful togetherness and collective desire to further travel the journey ahead and make Nigeria a better place to proudly bequeath to the next generation.
He, however, reassured all stakeholders that the 10th Senate would continue to make impactful legislations for Nigeria’s common good; under the leadership of the Senate President, Senator Godswill Akpabio.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/26204734/OPEYEMI-BAMIDELE.jpg

As we celebrate the 63rd Independence Anniversary – the liberty from colonial rule, we must remember the enormous sacrifices made by our founding fathers; Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Sir Ahmadu Bello and Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, among others, and recommit ourselves to the ideals they preached including the promotion of national unity, peace, justice, and tolerance.
“Yes, at 63, we have some challenges facing us as a country but they are surmountable. We will overcome them. Our country will come out stronger of its present challenges, by God’s grace.”
“Let’s continue to support President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to actualise his policies and programmes as encapsulated in the Renewed Hope Agenda. He has good intentions for the country. We will get it right”, Senator Barau added.

The development is coming barely 24 hours after Ganduje appointed the immediate past Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Masari, as chairman of a nine-man committee to intervene in the lingering feud between Ondo State governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, and his deputy, Lucky Aiyedatiwa.
In his goodwill message on Saturday, the APC national chairman called on the citizenry to remain hopeful, adding that measures already put in place by the APC-led administration would reposition the country to achieve growth and development.

He said, “Without a doubt, you will agree with me that the journey has not been without obstacles. It has been characterised by opportunities, prospects and challenges including a three-year civil war which has brought out the resilient Nigerian spirit of perseverance, industry and abiding faith in the country.
“As a party, let me restate that the APC will remain true to its promises and pledges to the people. None of these promises I repeat, will escape our attention and none will be treated lightly. The present administration led by President Bola Tinubu is ready to live up to the Renewed Hope manifesto to reposition Nigeria towards sustainable growth, development and economic prosperity.
“Fortunately he has hit the ground running to fix the infrastructural and economic reversals of the previous years. Under this administration, Nigerians can be rest assured that it will be fine again and your worries will soon be a thing of the past.      
“There will be sufficient jobs with decent wages, medicare, housing and other basic infrastructure that can guarantee the citizenry a better life.

The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Abbas Tajudeen, has congratulated Nigerians as they celebrate the country’s 63rd Independence Anniversary, saying the country will be great again.
While calling on fellow citizens and compatriots to keep hope in the country alive, the speaker said doomsayers and pessimists would soon be disappointed.
Despite the myriad of challenges facing Nigeria, Abbas noted that the country still has the prospect and potential to reclaim its leadership position in the comity of nations, especially with its abundant human and natural resources. 
He also urged the organised labour – Nigeria Labour Congress and the Trade Union Congress – to shelve the plan to embark on an indefinite nationwide strike on Tuesday over issues bothering on welfare.
“Embarking on a nationwide indefinite strike at this time would do the country no good. Rather, it would only aggravate the situation at hand, the Speaker said, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Musa Krishi, on Saturday.
“The organized labour should reason with the Federal Government and put the strike on hold by cooperating with the authorities so that all issues would be resolved amicably.

He also decried the brain drain being suffered by the country, stating that only Nigerians can rebuild their country to make its pasture greener.
“I urge young Nigerians to be more patriotic, using their talents and skills to develop their country.
“With the Renewed Hope Agenda of the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and the introduction of revolutionary policies and programmes, the government stands a better chance of winning the confidence of not just the youth but all citizens of the country,” he said.
While calling for support and prayers for the tiers and arms of the government at all levels, Abbas expressed optimism that the future is bright for Nigeria and Nigerians.
“The 10th House’s readiness is to accelerate the consideration and passage of legislation that will aid the growth and development of the country,” he said.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/15140045/Abbas-Tajudeen.jpg
